# Multiverse

Going back over the millenary history of Aumyr we realize how planar journeys and the possibility of moving to other worlds have directly influenced the world itself, allowing the colonization by the races of the Multiverse.

From the mystery of the origin of the Askarians and from the appearance of the first settlers through the Portal created by the Five, it was soon understood that moving to other worlds was no longer the prerogative of ancient magic or rituals now extinct: more and more enchanters have experimented with new methods to open Portals, Astral Corridors or other forms of travel to other dimensions. Some of them have reported entire populated planets, alternative realities, planets-caos, dimensions of pure imagination and more.

## Cosmogony

Theology often discusses the origin and millennial history of Aumyr.
All the knowledge of a pre-Civilization world is summarized in three great theories, or cosmogonies.

### The Colonization

This is the chronicle of the legendary and divine deeds of the Five travellers who first discovered the continent of Aumyr.

According to modern theology, their mortal remains are buried in a crypt-temple under the Palace of the Five in the city of Fivestar, in perpetual memory of their feat and their previously mortal nature. Their souls reside in a protected and inaccessible Plan, but some historians claim to have found some evidence that would confirm their involvement on earth in human form over different eras.

#### Creation of the World

On the day of the opening of the Portal, the Five Travellers arrived on the hill of that promontory of lava rock that would later become the center of the city of Fivestar. They realized that they had discovered a world completely different from their own and at that point they founded a first colony of exploration, starting to build a stable Dimensional Portal that would allow them to communicate with other planes. The discovery of a new world attracted a whole series of visitors from other dimensions. A large colonial outpost on the rocky promontory soon developed.

#### Society

Without any constraint from any kind of government or authority, a large part of the group of settlers set off for the continent, trying to start a new life. Small villages sprang up, then cities, and finally empires; races mixed together, the Native people were discovered, the ruins of the Askarians. The native world of the settlers was soon forgotten, while the Brotherhood took power as the sole and true repository of Knowledge. The city of Fivestar, in perpetual memory of their enterprise and their previously mortal nature. Their souls reside in a protected and inaccessible Plan, but some historians claim to have found some evidence that would confirm their involvement on earth in human form over different eras.

### The Transformation

The mythology of the natives of Aumyr, also known as "The Transformation" is always the same and is widely shared between them: in the beginning there was cosmic nothingness, incomprehensible emptiness, good and evil united.

#### Creation of the World

In order for mortals to understand the divine, cosmic nothingness changed itself into male and female, the Great Father and the Great Mother, and from them were born and evolved all living species, including the Heroes, first mortal and then assorted to semi-divine rank by virtue of their extraordinary deeds or faculties. The natives agree to establish the duality perpetrated by the Great Father and the Great Mother, in the form of two divinities, one male and one female.

#### Society

From a theological point of view, the fact that the supreme Father-Mother dualism has never generated other divinities or semi-divinities has led the Brotherhood to think that the mythology of the Natives has a tribal character that can be traced back to a past full of rites and traditions. Since the appearance of the Mark, the native priests and charmers think that their power, granted by the gods, may one day become extinct if the ancient customs of Tradition are not respected.

### Theory of the Ancients

This theory would see the Material Plan, and therefore the world itself, involved in a gigantic work of terraforming by a race of ascetics called Askari.

#### Creation of the World

Now they would have made the planet on which Aumyr is located habitable, to allow them to host their race. The Askarians extracted resources, built cities and modified the landscape, until a day when they ended up leaving the planet, as if threatened by an imminent danger. Their wisdom pervaded the earth so long, so much so that they left traces of their past even after the planetary upheavals due to the Cataclysm.

#### The natives

The natives would be a hybrid race magically created by the Askarians in order to perpetuate life on the planet even after their departure. Supporters of the Ancient Theory think that the three Observers are concrete proof of the Askarians' interest in other worlds, and that the existence of arcane magic is nothing more than a consequence of their immense power, which has pervaded everything during their stay.

#### The Gods

They believe in the existence of the Five as "adventurers who found themselves in the right place at the right time", that is, during a period of rebirth of the planet, which allowed them to acquire control of much of the territory to be claimed as a "new world". The elderly members of the Brotherhood would be a brotherhood that has been handing down the Knowledge for generations, waiting for the Askarians to show themselves one more day on the planet and to give them immense powers.

## The Void

It is also known as Astral Plan, Astral Sea, Transition Plan. For some it is the place of wonders that contains all the other existing planes, while for others it acts only as an empty and sterile link between the Material Plan and other dimensions.

It is a colorless and infinite space that continues everything that has existed, exists and will still exist, where some currents called "astral winds" drift into the void dragging every particle of matter and non-matter. If you are particularly lucky, you can come across long silver chains called "Astral Corridors": these are roads that can be travelled with the force of thought that connect different planes.

### The Eternal Vortex

Considered by many to be the centre of the Multiverse, it is a place made up of several whirling dimensions, which merge and separate infinitely producing incredible amounts of energy, which in turn expands through the astral winds to the ends of the universe. Within this space it is possible to define the four main elements: Air, Earth, Fire and Water.

## Planes

### First (Material Plane)

The Material Plan, also called the Natural Plan, is the main plan of existence on which events take place and time flows as in the real world. In essence, the Material Plan coincides with the very world of Aumyr.

### External Plans

They are often identified as Peripheral Plans, or Kingdoms.

#### Plane of Order

It is a realm where the material takes on geometric shapes, rigorous proportions and mathematical alignments. In this world where everything is cohesive and derivable, nothing is left to chance. Beings of pure form shape splendid architectures, which in turn blend with the harmony and perfection of the landscape.

#### Plane of Chaos

It is impossible to reach the Chaos Plan and know the way to go. The plane changes continuously, nothing is ever fixed in a point, matter is composed and decomposes almost as it happens in the nearby Eternal Vortex. Rumour has it that some sentient creatures inhabit floating masses of earth pushed to drift and scourged by transformation and change.

#### Upper Reign

It's the place of eternal bliss. From various cultures also called Paradise, Heavenly Mount, Nirvana, in it dwell creatures ascended and beings with divine powers, immersed in eternal peace and harmony. The dimension is formed by numerous levels that can take many forms according to the desires of those who live there.

#### Lower Reign

Also known as Hell, Abyss, Gehenna. Very few of those who venture here can say that they know something about this dimension. It is known to be the home of demons, devils and far worse horrors immersed in mephitic swamps, while the unbreathable air is swept away by storms of fire and acid rain.

### Parallel Plans

They are also called Intermediate Plans. They are realities that contain, wrap and overlap with the Material Plan. For some they are much more, perhaps something that links reality itself. Even if we know of the existence of only four parallel planes, we hypothesize that still unexplored realities can exist.

#### Plane of Shadow

This is the dark version of the Piano Materiale, whose topography is constantly changing slowly under a vault of black clouds. There are no colors, but shades of gray. Finding points of light is rare, and what remains hidden in the dark can be lethal.

#### Ethereal Plane

It is adjacent to the Piano Materiale and appears almost as a "distorted" version, with vast foggy landscapes, greys, greys and blues, pervaded by a dim soft light that seems to originate from the same fog. Here, sight, hearing and touch seem numb.

#### Reverse Plane

The Reverse Plan (also known as the Plan of Mirrors, Plan of the Contraries, Alternative Dimension) is a plan of existence clone that overlaps the Material Plan, sharing the topography and all the elements, but are altered in order to represent the opposite of what exists on its twin. For example, a kind and selfless spirit charmer could be an evil warrior, an open box could be closed, and so on.

Although there is no concrete evidence that the plan really exists, some say that a powerful Artifact known as Fragments of the Mirror is actually a key to accessing this alternative dimension.

#### Negative Plane

Achieving this plan is extremely difficult as well as very dangerous. Once you enter the plane you can't see or breathe, because of the dense cloak of darkness, and there is no food or water. It is not like in the Ethereal Plan. Here is something, a pulsating darkness that sucks life, dries up the spirit and devours the very soul of the living.

#### Positive Plane

It is a plan of penetrating light, and precautions must be taken not to be immediately blinded. In reality, the plane is empty, there is no air, no food, no water. The wounds heal here at an impressive speed, it is even possible that the energy starts to consume the bodies by self-combustion.

## Dimensions

Even for the wise it is impossible to understand the multiverse in its entirety. In it everything originates and everything ends. In every advanced civilization there is a reference to something unknown, profoundly alien and inconceivable. It is possible that the dimensions we understand are only a part of the whole, and that much escapes us completely. Some talk about "spaces" between dimensions, where it is possible that something can "filter" through them.

### The Crossroads

It would be a unique and legendary place, created to serve as a stopover to all the worlds of the universes. Its existence has only been theorized by the Brotherhood's wise men and by the scholars of the Portals.

### Temporal Plane

Some philosophers and wise men argue that time is just an illusion created by life so that the mortal can understand the concepts of birth and death. It is possible that in every multiverse there is a sort of dimension of control, an infinite plane from where it is possible to access any event through manipulations of the fabric of reality. This is a subject that is often debated between the Brotherhood and the Custodes of Knowledge.

### Dreamlands

It is said that the essence of any creature with the ability to dream ends up in this plan. Dreams are a subject full of mystery: am I a joke of our mind or is it possible that, when we sleep, our spirit can enter a completely different dimension?

### Elsewhere, the Worlds of the Beyond

These generic names represent the very concept of the unknown, the point of origin of all that is unknown and alien. From these non-places come unnamed creatures, abominations and pure beings generated by madness.
