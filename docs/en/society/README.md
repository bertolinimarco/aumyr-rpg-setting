# Society

Aumyr is a continent populated by hundreds of creatures and is home to many races and cultures. Each civilization succeeds another, in an eternal cycle that does not seem to end. It almost always happens that the next civilization discovers the remains of a past race and draws power and knowledge from it. The current state of the world is the result of thousands of years of stories and events.

## Natives

Natives are a race vaguely similar to humans with olive and wild traits, with the only difference of a slightly elongated skull. Their culture and history is what most influenced the planet after the disappearance of the Askarians and until the arrival of the Five. They are thought to have owned settlements all over the continent, before they retired to the island-region of Inkari, following the People's War. Since then the whole island has become a kind of sacred ground where you can pass on their ancient culture called "Tradition", a complex amalgamation of parchments, writings, tables, prophecies and institutions.

### Personality

Half of them fear the legends of the ancient Askari because of the legends about the Mark, while the other half consider it only a past epoch and attribute to the curse different origins. Since the arrival of the Five on Aumyr, the natives have been considered by most of the population as a dispersed tribe: in the continental lands they are often gathered in reserves or other protected places, more or less isolated from the rest of the population. Since the year 2372 EC their union with other races is not considered a taboo, at least on the continent. The natives are excellent companions, proud and faithful. They admire initiative, and in general all those who manage to live their lives according to a personal moral code.

### Adventurers

Natives who decide to leave Inkari and choose to become adventurers often have as their desire to know their destiny, atone for some guilt or simply discover new cultures. Their curious and brilliant nature helps to make them suitable to play any role within a group of adventurers, although it is not uncommon to find lonely and introverted natives who prefer a life away from the glories and comforts of civilization.

### A tormented past

All natives suffer from a curse called the Mark. It is a kind of genetic virus that makes it very difficult for newborns to survive. For these reasons, the death of one of them is seen as a moment of shared mourning and the offspring is held in the highest regard. Some old wise men consider it a punishment of the ancient Askarians for profaning their graves and this has given rise to a whole series of stories and beliefs that have deeply marked the cultural and social aspect of their evolution from the time of the People's War until today.

### Pride and curiosity

The centre of their corporate structure is a dynastic family structure called the Tribe. Each tribe has a key figure called Xoraki, a sort of elderly householder, whether male or female. The natives love to earn a living, many are mercenaries but among them there are also adventurers. Of curious nature, almost childish. Those who practice magic often make it an inordinate, sometimes superfluous (eg: spells to sweep the floors, create small objects, pour water, lift heavy loads, etc. ...). Because of this passion, some of the most brilliant (or fanatical) of arcane or divine magic are Native. As for physical abilities, those who focus on the arts of survival and battle usually become excellent warriors, barbarians or rangers.

### Passion and loyalty

The nature of a Native is centered on respect for Independence, Freedom and Tradition. These three moral cornerstones have led the Natives to be a people that tends to be tolerant, though very jealous of their own historical heritage that they call Tradition.

### Culture

For a Native, the external behaviour of an individual is the result of an alternation of opposite, complementary and inseparable internal states. They are free spirits who hate all forms of coercion. They tend to observe the world around them as an infinite network of causes and consequences. The heavy burden of the Mark and its mysterious origin has deeply influenced them, and it is very rare for their character to reach extremes of benevolence or evil.

### Religion

Almost all the natives adore the Great Father and the Great Mother. Native theology does not recognize the Five as independent divinities, but as "emanations" of the Great Father and the Great Mother, in turn "children" of a higher entity.

### The Mark

All natives suffer from a curse called the Mark. It is a kind of genetic virus that makes it very difficult for newborns to survive. For these reasons, the death of one of them is seen as a moment of shared mourning and the offspring is held in the highest regard. Some old wise men consider it a punishment of the ancient Askarians for profaning their graves and this has given rise to a whole series of stories and beliefs that have deeply marked the cultural and social aspect of their evolution from the times of the Wars of Peoples until today.

### Tribes

The names of the tribes are formed by two volcables, usually the initials of the ancestors or the oldest ancestors of the tribe itself, such as Aum-Ner, Bal-Desha, Crex-Urdo, Dom-Makar, Etro-Zol, FarEor, Gal-Har, Kel-Marak, Mol-Ghar, Nel-Torak, Phar-Mar, Sana-Kel, Vos-Nazel, Yore-Vor, Zao-Zul.

## Askari

According to legends, the Askari (_Ancient Askari_ or simply _Ancients_) were a very powerful people of Ascended, or creatures with boundless intelligence and power, with the ability to manipulate the matter of creation. What was the fate of the Askarians? Were they divinities, demons, powerful sorcerers, beings from other dimensions, or were they simply a great technologically advanced race? To date, these questions remain unanswered.

Tangible evidence of their existence is often before everyone's eyes: large buildings hidden or buried in remote places, dungeons infested with abominable creatures and dotted with fragments of advanced metallurgical technology. The legends about their disappearance from Aumyr are countless. The ancient cotilisation of the Askari is an integral part of the myth of the Ascetics, also known as the Theory of the Ancients.

### The Knowledge

The world is permeated with magic. But what is it fed by and what is its origin? This and other notions are classified as Knowledge. Often the discoveries concern mainly the ancient Askari race so for most people the Knowledge scholars are experts in pre-colonization cultures. In fact, the field of knowledge defined as Knowledge also covers other aspects, such as the creation of magical objects and new spells, alchemy and in general the perception of the Multiverse.

Many people think that magic is the fabric that connects the world, a network that unites visible and invisible reality. The Askari have left the planet, but their trace survives among spells, rituals, magical constructs, Observers and Portals, structures of incredible ingenuity and not reproducible with current instruments. Much of the ancient culture is now lost in time and has assumed the name of Knowledge. The wise are convinced that playing with Knowledge is neither wise nor safe. Yet, there are always adventurers ready to dig the sands of the fiery deserts, or to explore the subsoil in search of lost powers and immense wealth.

## Organizations

Life is short on Aumyr and every social relationship is crucial. For this reason, over the centuries, organizations have been created that can control and manage almost every aspect of daily life, from war to healing. Organizations are always looking for new members and some have the support of the Brotherhood, have offices in taverns and offer a variety of services, according to their skills. As payment they use some of the riches shared by the guild, after deduction of expenses. Other benefits can be obtained by rank and title.

### The Brotherhood

The Brotherhood controls most of the world, is home to some of the most powerful users of magic and manages everything from adventurers to bounty, from justice to religion. It is the organization that holds the political power (supervision of territories, trade and more). Although it encourages the discovery of Askari knowledge by various adventurers or explorers, the Brotherhood often keeps the activity of treasure seekers under control in the larger or older ruins, mainly to prevent destruction or collapse, preserving some dungeons as if they were important archaeological sites.

#### Structure

The centre of power is the Council, a small group of senior members of the Brotherhood. They are famous both for their extraordinary longevity and for holding office until their death. Whenever it is necessary to elect one or more senior members of the Council, a Council is convened which sees all the members of the Brotherhood propose themselves for the title. Voting is a secret process that takes place in the Inner Rooms of the Palace of Five, in Fivestar. The Brotherhood often recruits adventurers to carry out some particular mission, such as recovering ancient relics, exploring dungeons or snorting out monsters and creatures in villages and towns. Their power makes them an excellent employer for adventurers in need of money.

#### Reputation

Their dual management of political and religious power has made them very powerful, almost as if they represented the very world of Aumyr. Like any power group, it is both loved and hated. Generally the Council of the Brotherhood appears publicly for sermons on the spread of magic in its various forms, to promote peace and knowledge. Some conspiracy fanatics argue that it is only a puppet government and that quite different realities have real political and territorial control of the world.

### Guardians of Knowledge

The Guardians of Knowledge are a group formed mainly by Masters who are often too old to perform their normal functions. They also include users of magic, both arcane and divine, but above all wise people with an academic interest that ranges from teaching to read to anyone who wants to learn, to the use of the rudiments of magic, and more. In order to join as initiates it is customary to donate part of one's assets to the organization, and in return all the advantages and diplomatic immunities worthy of this title are provided. They are generally of legal alignment.

#### Structure

Each Custos is usually the owner of a piece of land or his own manor, donated to him by the population, received as a gift for his rank or earned through adventures and itinerant missions. The majority of them spend their patrimony to build a library or to found a school of magic, all places suitable for the conservation and diffusion of the divine and arcane knowledge. Others prefer to be tutors in small villages or large cities. The title of Master is appreciated and well paid in every civilized outpost of Aumyr.

#### Reputation

Old Masters are the cornerstone of education and literacy for most people on the continent. Because of their role in small organized societies, most of them are well-off, which allows them to live in peace for the rest of their lives. It is possible that before retiring to private life many of them were adventurers or popular heroes, or that they are still popular when they receive the title of Master, completed the difficult initiation path called "Wandering Novitiate".

### Primordial Faith

In the islands of Inkari, before colonization, a small circle of Natives, inhabitants of the northern part of the island, rather than the typical cults of the place turned their faith to the divine essence of nature, developing an animist conception of the universe. Thus was born what is now known on Aumyr as the Primordial Faith. During the Ancient Era, the Faith, born in Inkari, gradually spread throughout Aumyr as a result of the various wanderings of priests. Nowadays there are still some celebrants of the Faith, mostly Druids and Shamans. To celebrate ancestral rituals, formulate powerful natural spells and exchange messages secretly, the faithful adopt a cryptic language hidden from most: the Primeval.

#### Structure

On Aumyr there is no fixed seat of the Faith, as over time have been formed around the world various circles in the various biomes, mainly autonomous and diversified between them as regards the aspects of Nature revered. The Circles are not very numerous, formed by an old man who covers the role of Wise and Head of the circle, the role lasts from when you are elected until his death. The role of a Wise Man is full of responsibility, knowledge and power. Although the activities of the Faith remain secret to most people, in reality the various circles often meet at events related to nature, such as the beginning of a new season, to celebrate sacred festivities for the brotherhood.

#### Reputation

On Aumyr it is rare to meet a priest of the Primordial Faith in civilized places, rather you may happen to come across one of them if you travel through ancient places and steeped in natural magic. Often they are solitary but friendly hermits willing to help those in need. For this reason it is generally recognized by the population that a druid or a shaman is of good heart, given their connection with Primeva Magic, associated with the balance of Nature and good. However, some rumors suggest that within the Black Swamp is hidden the home of a Circle of Druids with mysterious intent, practicing blasphemous rituals and cruel and dark sacrifices.

### Sons of Hardon

The Sons of Hardon is a warrior's company made up of former soldiers, powerful commanders, barbarians and people in general who have dedicated their lives to the arts of combat. They perform various functions such as guards, escorts (some of them are also members of the Crusader Swords and other companies) and for compensation can teach the basics of war even to those who have never held a sword in their hands. The Sons of Hardon are an organization united by a spirit of common belonging, forged by the fire of a thousand battles. They are generally of legal alignment.

#### Structure

Although they have a main base in Fivestar, they use taverns as meeting points. Recruitment takes place mainly in large cities, but you need to pass a combat-oriented selection in order to be able to have the title of full-fledged member. Once you get the title, you are admitted to the ranks of the Sons of Hardon for life. Some of them undertake a path outside the organization, which often leads them to deny their membership, often as a result of tasks solved in tragedy or loss of loved ones.

#### Reputation

The hard selection makes the Sons of Hardon particularly suitable for cooperation and defense of a group, but also to become great Leaders or Strategies of War in governments or royal courts. This is why many of them become adventurers, serving in the local temple. It is possible to come across their garrisons every time you visit a particularly hostile city or area, since many of them, war and military tactics experts, can take care of the defense of an outpost or the organization of permanent military bases.

### Red Brotherhood

The adventurers of the Red Brotherhood are dedicated to the destruction of the undead. They are based in the fortress village of Shieldbane, from where they launch frequent attacks against groups of undead from the nearby ruins of Gherzul or other dungeons.

#### Structure

The Red Brotherhood is financed not only by the Brotherhood but also by the Worship of Melian. Its members are called "Brothers" and have a paramilitary hierarchical structure based on seniority of service. To enlist, one can apply directly to the Order, although many are enlisted after being noticed for some particularly heroic mission. They have various locations, usually close to "inauspicious" places such as dungeons, ruins or abandoned fortresses.

#### Reputation

The Brothers, much respected, are seen as priests and warriors. They often accompany the Sons of Hardon and the priests of Melian in their crusades against evil in its various forms. Every Brother knows that he has a secure home in every place occupied by the Brotherhood. Their mission is to protect the world of the living from the attack of the non-living world. They are mostly followers of Melian, but it is not excluded that the worshipper of another deity may enter the Brotherhood and climb its ranks. Some of them are also members of the Dorne Society, either as consultants or as active explorers. The great knowledge of the undead, the result of centuries of war and study, also makes them experts in exorcism, possessions and spiritual manifestations in dungeons, castles, ruined fortresses or forgotten underground halls. Some think that control of the Red Brotherhood is in the hands of a group of visionaries who can observe the world from both sides of the Veil, a sort of "filter" dimension that separates the kingdom of the living from that of the dead.

### The Wolfguard

Established in the same years as the Dorne Society, the Wolf Guard is made up of rangers, explorers and all those who can boast survival skills in the wild. It is an independent organization, free from the control of the Brotherhood. Their history is ancient and heroic. They usually patrol forests and woodlands, but also less green places such as mountains, glaciers or fiery deserts. They defend villages from attacks by mountain creatures, maintain diplomatic agreements with wild Native tribes, and more. They differ from the Dorne Society in that they do not play an exploratory role, but of control and territorial order, a sort of alternative to the Brotherhood.

#### Structure

Historically, they have their headquarters in the village of Deepwood in Boscoscuro, but also various branch offices, especially in small border villages. In recent years their number has increased due to frequent explorations by adventurers in remote places in search of treasures or lost knowledge. Some people think that their base is the world itself and that they do not have a real official seat.

#### Reputation

I am among the first to carry out dangerous tasks of exploration and reclamation of wild lands. Their members are experienced rangers and warriors, able to survive in the most extreme conditions. Some of them prefer isolation from big cities, convinced that life can offer a better experience in the open air than in identical square houses and without a story to tell.

### The Circle

The members of the Circle criticize the work of the Brotherhood, often with violent public demonstrations and other actions of protest. Although the Brotherhood is the leader of the world and holds the highest authority in religious matters, many claim that it is only a controlling body and that it has in some way taken advantage of the coming of the Five to acquire political and religious power to govern the world.

#### Structure

The group is made up of each class and each race, convinced that the Brotherhood should loosen its political and religious grip on the world. They hope for the creation of an autonomous government, not driven by the will of a group of old and elitist sorcerers. They have many offices, even if no officers, often preferring anonymity in which members gather in small groups to organize themselves territorially. They also seem to have a dense network of spies who oversee the work of the Brotherhood and the affiliates who gravitate around it, such as adventurers or popular heroes.

#### Reputation

There are those who think that it is only a gigantic network of conspirators aimed at subverting the order constituted for the personal gain of some members hidden at the top of the organization. Among its ranks are common thieves, murderers, but also politicians and local rulers: very useful contacts for those who want to organize clandestine operations away from the omnipresent eyes of the government. Given their subversive nature, they are primarily responsible for attacks on the constituted power or other actions of reprisal or urban guerrilla warfare. Their motto is "Freedom from the Few", indicating their political and social utopia. They are generally of chaotic alignment.

### Mercatus

A secret organization formed by an elite of merchants who are united for the management of the world economy, for purposes of control and power. Their existence is not official, but it has been theorized recently by a large group of fanatical conspirators. If we consider trade as an actual organism, they are the ones who control it in a hidden way, through the control of money and wealth. They are generally of chaotic alignment.

#### Structure

They do not have a known seat, and it seems they are divided into territorial groups that privately recruit each new member. Some of them are contacted after having witnessed particular events related to their machinations. A large part of the population is, however, unaware of the presence of this organization, convinced that it is not possible to exercise any kind of control over prices, demand and supply, due to the commercial complexity and the fragmentation of the market between the territories.

#### Reputation

It is often considered to be the occult instigator of many enigmatic and obscure episodes of the story. Some of the actions of this organization include: disappearances of caravans with particular goods, impoverishment of strategic areas to unleash revolts and control the fear of the people, conspiracies in royal courts, and many other events of social, historical or political importance. Many people think that their real power lies in having entire courts, or less famous branches of governments, such as trade controls, the management of communications and in general all the services carried out in the shadow of more prominent organizations, in their ranks.

### Order of Gnosis

It represents an ancient order of former adventurers and heroes, wise men and hermits. Those who manage to acquire a superior knowledge of the Askari or their dark past, to master dangerous spells and to observe the very nature of creation, are invited to join the Order of Gnosis, a small group of experts, especially formed by adventurers veterans or famous sages, very elitist and very mysterious.

#### Structure

They do not have a permanent seat and few know the affiliates as they are almost always summoned by senior members of the Brotherhood and only on special occasions. It is thought that their relationship with the Brotherhood is very close and that their secret meeting place is the Crypts of Fivestar, the place of the Arrival of the Five.

#### Reputation

Often being consulted on the occasion of major dilemmas, wars between Regions and other major problems, each member is considered to be like an old member of the Brotherhood: a very powerful individual. Many know that their nature often makes them beyond any form of containment or law. In some of them a sense of superiority and arrogance develops which, in the worst case, can contribute to destabilizing the political or social balance of entire regions. If they are recognized, they tend to prefer solitude or a very modest life: feeling the weight of Knowledge on them, they tend to prefer roles as advisors or teachers behind the scenes of the events of the world. The detractors of this organization think that they participate in secret meetings aimed at manipulating the consciences of entire governments just for the sake of seeing them "dance" according to their desire or their personal ambitions.

### Society of Dorne

The adventurers of the Dorne Society are known to have explored the most remote dungeons and killed monsters that are very hard to find. It is formed by many explorers, adventurers and heroes who have helped map most of the world on behalf of the Brotherhood. Their work is very dangerous, but it can also be very lucrative, new members to the first missions often earn enough treasures to retire permanently after a few months.

#### Structure

The Society has many outposts located throughout the continent (and beyond). Most members are so experienced that they operate alone or in small groups, but they are also used to organizing entire expeditions when the danger becomes greater, as well as the risk of missions. However, they are anything but reckless: their camaraderie is legendary and for many members of the Society, serving in the chosen body is an honor and a privilege. At the head of this organization is elected by secret vote a Great Explorer, who is often an adventurer or a hero who through his actions has contributed to the advancement of knowledge or the discovery of new information of historical or archaeological interest.

#### Reputation

The Dorne Society, like the Wolf Guard, is also very well seen by the border population and in all places where the protection offered by the Brotherhood is less present. Some of their most experienced and courageous members are called "Great Explorers", a sort of elite recognition of the company, and often also real commanders of the Society itself. Some theories believe that this organization has objectives other than a simple love of exploration: they could be custodians of secret knowledge, hidden from the eyes of the world.

### Crusader swords

This free company specializes in private security. The members of the Crusader Swords crew are often mercenaries destined to protect mansions or caravans and others are hired as personal bodyguards by wealthy members of the nobility. The work is generally tedious but the pay is stable, with bonuses bestowed for various exceptional services.

#### Structure

They deal with armed escort, mercenary protection, recruitment and training of troops of soldiers or charmers specializing in magical clashes. They are often seen alongside caravans of wealthy merchants, or on foot as bodyguards of nobles or celebrities. They are thought to use a magical communication system that allows them to quickly exchange secret information or communications on behalf of their clients. Given the confidentiality of their assignments, there is no precise method of joining the organization except to try to be noticed by some affiliate. In this environment, knowing your job is crucial, and newcomers are often put to the test with impossible assignments, suicide missions and more. The center of power is the Forum of Swords, a kind of board of senior and particularly powerful members.

#### Reputation

Anyone who takes a Crusader Sword knows they're getting the most out of it. Although only nobles and great merchants can afford the figures proposed by the members of this organization, in recent times have increased the demands for enlistment. Probably some people think that a life of active service is easy, when in reality it is not so. Many are almost permanently employed by their employers and the luckiest often come to occupy considerable positions of power.

### Xao-Thol

Outcast wizards, crazy sorcerers, bloody warriors, murderers are only a part of the infamous group of Xao-Thol. Unlimited individualists, this organization includes all those who have no problem getting rid of obstacles to achieve their goals, at any level of madness or ambition. They are generally of chaotic alignment.

#### Structure

They don't have a home. It is said that they usually recruit by recommendation of other members, who play a role of guarantor for the newcomer. It seems that at the head of this mysterious group of independentists lies a dense network of cells or autonomous groups to which other cells belong, making it impossible to go back to the top of the ginning, if any. Each member knows that he belongs to a cell, a group of people who often replace his family, so much is the amount of time that some of them dedicate to it. The cells thus formed are charged with various missions, which can range from the supply of goods to the sabotage of caravans or arcane laboratories.

#### Reputation

Although most believe it to be a bewildering group of madmen, hermits or singular individuals, it is said that this organization hides an ancient history, which finds its roots with the arrival of the Five on Aumyr. Xao-Thol cells are often small groups of magicians who secretly gather to respond to the will of the organization, which sends them secret messages or code. The nature of the assignments is always different, but the rewards for serving the Xao-Thol never take long to arrive, in the form of favors, powers or lost knowledge.

## Backgrounds

### Adept of the Brotherhood

An enchanter usually has many options to advance in the field of arcane arts. He can lead an independent life or join an adventurer. Others decide to join the Brotherhood, to take advantage of some of the advantages. An Adept of the Brotherhood is often a calculating and enterprising character. Climbing the ranks of the oldest organization in the world is an undertaking that few can accomplish definitively. Many of them decide to carve out minor roles or comfort, taking advantage of the financial and social coverage offered by the Brotherhood.

Once chosen by the Brotherhood, they are assigned to a region and divided according to the skills acquired during a training period at the Fivestar Palace. All Adepts, whether voluntary or selected in advance, enjoy certain privileges given by their rank within the Brotherhood. Through their influence within the organization, they can access libraries or private collections, know the location of secret dungeons or protected treasures, can find information about people, places or entire villages and more. Although they are called Adepts of the Brotherhood, their destiny is not always to spend their lives working on behalf of the Brotherhood itself. Many of them choose the path of the adventurer, for various reasons: whether they want to wander the world in search of lost treasures and relics, or simply want to take advantage of some of their contacts within the organization, the path of each Adept is mysterious and full of opportunities.

### Adept of the Primordial Faith

An adept of the Primordial Faith often devotes his entire life to worship, following particular ways and customs typical of the Circle of belonging. To begin, however, there are no racial or age restrictions of any kind, it is enough to be recognized as worthy by the Elder of the Circle.

Each Circle induces its faithful to follow particular principles, there are those who lead a life more savage and those instead of peace and harmony, but each affiliate is united by a strong love for nature in all its expressions, especially towards the aspects revered by the Circle of belonging. However, there is no shortage of believers who have decided to live as hermits, often nomads or guardians of sacred places. Although an adept spends his whole life in a particular biome, it is not so rare for someone to decide to go on an adventure; this is to help a group of adventurers, both to act as messengers or ambassadors to other circles. There are those who decide to return once their mission has been accomplished, but there are also those who find something new in the adventure, such as a love of travel or worship for another aspect of Nature. The most popular circles are the Circle of the Hot Sands, the Circle of the Eternal Tree and the Circle of the Millenary Stone, located respectively in the desert, forests and mountains. There are also rumours about a hypothetical Circle of Frost, probably located in the northernmost areas of Aumyr.

### Occult Hunter

It is a group of adventurers who have dedicated their lives to the study of the undead. Those who choose the way of the Occult Hunter are often clerics, paladins or warriors. They play the role of investigators and executioners, studying throughout their lives the habits and characteristics of secret sects, unnamed cults, hordes of zombies, skeletons and other cursed creatures. Many of them belong to the Red Brotherhood, because of the many goals in common with this organization.

The typical Occult Hunter is an adventurer who has sworn to find and destroy everything that should not cross the veil of life. During the 110 EC Disaster of the Dead Islands, thousands of people were orphaned by their families or loved ones, slaughtered by hordes of infernal creatures. Many of them joined the organization that later became the Red Brotherhood, and others swore to destroy every undead until the end of their lives. It is not uncommon to see many Paladins join their Vow of Revenge to the career of a travelling hunter and adventurer. Most of the Occult Hunters serve in the Red Brotherhood, always happy to have among their ranks specialized warriors and connoisseurs of the undead. Those who join the Brothers crave to be able to venture, one day, in the famous ruin of Gherzul, the Great Necropolis: an immense dungeon full of cursed creatures. Some prefer to offer themselves as mercenaries, trying to make a living in the villages and towns or seeking revenge because of a friend, brother or missing companion. Others seek fortune as solitary explorers, grave-robbers, renegade clerics and hermits. In many taverns you can hear stories of many adventurers perished among forgotten catacombs, surrounded in the dark by unnamed creatures, but there are also many stories of legendary heroes, true protectors and bulwarks of hope in the darkness of the undead.

### Explorer of Dorne

They represent the embodiment of the perfect adventurer: an indomitable explorer and a wise observer, prepared to survive in extreme territories. Few of them devote themselves to a sedentary life, preferring a panorama full of ruins and territories to explore. Every new ruin and every new discovery is for an explorer a moment worthy of meaning, mystery and opportunity.

Anyone is able to make a journey to an unknown destination, but not everyone becomes an Explorer. Their passion for the unknown challenges any physical or mental constraint, helping to prepare them for often reckless and daring actions. Prepared and often experienced guides in all fields, many of them devote themselves to a life full of action and danger, exploring forgotten dungeons, mapping remote areas or discovering new forms of animal or plant life in some remote outpost in the mountains. Their goal is often the taste for knowledge gained through the discovery of archaeological finds, or lost treasures. The curiosity that drives them can have various origins ranging from pure academic knowledge to mere material wealth. They prefer to travel alone or in small groups. Because of their unique set of skills, they are always welcome in any company of adventurers.

### Son of Hardon

Anyone can become a Son of Hardon. These proud and brave warriors are among Aumyr's most feared fighters. Many of them become Strategists in the service of courts and governments. Others embark on an adventurous career to find new and exciting challenges around the corner.

Becoming a member of the Sons of Hardon is considered an honor for many warriors. Their discipline allows them to be always ready for action and tenacious in many situations where others would be ready to flee. Throughout history, many members of this organization have exploited its tactical and strategic knowledge, gathering armies to try to gain a role within the military hierarchy of the Brotherhood. Today, the Sons of Hardon have shifted much of their collective activities to the benefit of the community or themselves. Many heroes belonging to the Sons are remembered, as are many generals who died in battle over the centuries.

### Guardian of the Frontier

At every frontier point, heroes protect the outposts of civilization from the raids of the creatures of the wild lands. They are often part of an organization known as the Wolf Guard. The Frontier Guardians are experienced guides and tenacious adventurers.

Many Guardians are adventurers or protectors of a small village. Their skills are in great demand in border areas and in all those where the Brotherhood's gaze cannot reach. Some of them are members of the Wolf Guard. A career within the organization is an uphill road but full of opportunities: great treasures, fighting in villages at the extreme of the world, killing of large beasts and monstrous creatures.

### Melian's Light

Only a few individuals are born with the Gift of Life, an innate power that allows them to heal wounds by touch and heal illnesses in a miraculous way. They form a select group of protectors known as Melian Lights. It is said that their senses can feel evil in all its manifestations, as well as areas of negative energy, or alterations of the veil of death.

Born with innate divine abilities, they are almost always on their way to clerical careers. They are positive individuals, intent on following their own path of faith. In border villages they are always welcome because of their empathy and ability to heal wounds. Educated from an early age, their destiny unfolds along many paths, once they reach adulthood. Some decide to settle in villages or towns. Others pursue the career of itinerant adventurers, determined to bring the power of the Gift to anyone who crosses their path.

### Master Builder

Experienced architects, they are able to design and build buildings, castles or entire city districts. Their work is often at the service of the Brotherhood for the construction and maintenance of governmental or religious buildings. Some of them become adventurers, tired of a life among parchments, wood and stone.

Although most people think of the Master Builders as a dwarf organization, all races are represented in a balanced way within the summits of power. This also brings several advantages when it comes to sharing architectural or construction knowledge. Those who wish to become adventurers are often great creatives, or scholars in search of new ideas or materials for their creations.

Often the greatest desire of a Master Builder is to see his name associated with a great work or invention that advances the history of the world, or that shakes the foundations of the same. It is not uncommon for some old Masters to decide to or isolate themselves in some remote place in order to create something unique, the fruit of the work of a lifetime, an eternal witness to their technical knowledge.

### Reaper

The priests of Vel-Shar call themselves Reapers. They represent and administer the will of the goddess on a material level. They often hide their identity and their belonging to the cult, to creep into political, military or governmental ranks.

Given the nature of their beliefs, they often undertake different careers, but always linked to the orders of the Will of Vel-Shar. Not everyone turns out to be just fanatics of chaos and destruction. Others prefer to use their skills to join a group of adventurers in search of treasures and discoveries. Although Vel-Shar demands absolute discipline and devotion, sometimes the reapers abandon any dependence on worship to pursue their own path. This leads them to become skilled thieves or murderers, able to infiltrate the ranks of a guild and corrupt powerful, as well as to disappear into the crowd, stealing treasures and other illicit activities.

### Wise of Gnosis

They are seen by the population as heroes, for better or for worse. Given their profound vision of Knowledge, they are called to play the role of counselors to the Brotherhood. The exact number of members of this exclusive order is unknown, but their number is constantly increasing, a sign that every day powerful forces move in secret.

They are enigmatic individuals. In some regions they are worshipped as true divine heralds, or Prechosen. Sometimes their nature makes them hermits, shy and unwilling to come into contact with other people. Knowledge offers them many powers, comparable to those of powerful charmers or great fighters. Their destiny follows that of the heroes and events of the world. Some people think that they are actually a secret caste of Askari returned and willing to change the time and events of Aumyr. Often, however, they are just individuals blessed or cursed by powers that even they sometimes find it hard to fully understand.
