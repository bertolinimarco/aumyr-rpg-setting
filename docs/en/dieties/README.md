Aumyr is a land of magic, adventure, mystery and powerful heroes.
Sometimes this power collides with the plots and vicissitudes of the gods: beings ascended to a higher status. Anyone on Aumyr can become a god, as long as he has worshippers and a power so high as to compete with that of the gods themselves. The road to immortality is full of obstacles and sacrifices, often too great and terrible.

## The Five

In the year 2372 EC there were a total of seven gods recognised on Aumyr.
Five of them represent the Five Travellers, the first to have found themselves on the new planet, considered the most important gods by all non-Natians. The other two remaining are native gods of the Natives, the inhabitants of the planet before the colonization of the Five.
Given the epic nature of the enterprise of these Five Heroes, they were elected Gods of the world by the first colonists, and acquired all the powers of this status.

### Hardon

Hardon is the quintessence of the warrior. Stubborn and devoted to a cause, he is the favorite deity of Warriors and Paladins. He is often not considered the wisest, but woe to those who suffer his anger or pose as his enemies. He is Melian's wife and tries to please her in every way, without knowing that he is prey to her continuous manipulations for her personal pleasure. Because of these special characteristics, new fathers often invoke Hardon to protect their firstborn children.

> May the will guide you, O Son. From the swamps to the peaks of the mountains, in the desert or in the ice, may it not abandon you in difficult times, when you suffer or when you are lost. May it protect you and show you the way when it is hidden, making you freer.

#### Clerics of Hardon

It is wrong to think that Hardon clerics lay the foundations of worship on the worship of physical strength. There are many interpretations of the doctrine among the various worshippers. Some people think that strength comes from experience and wisdom, rather than from skills in battle. Usually a Hardon cleric is a warrior anyway. Whether he fights elegantly or brutally, the will of a Hardon worshipper is difficult to break and is often considered among the best prepared clerics in situations where confrontation is the only chance of salvation.

### Melian

Melian is Hardon's wife. With a changing personality, sometimes manipulative, sometimes incredibly generous, she is often depicted as an attractive elf. In the group of Five, she held divine powers, which led her Cult to be one of the most adored by healers and clerics.

> Chaos leads to Destruction. Just as the veil separates the kingdom of the living from that of the dead, so must the soul be able to surrender to the laws of nature, as repositories of true balance. Help preserve life, and you will save much more than yourself.

#### Clerics of Melian

The Cult of Melian has grown over the centuries as the largest clerical institution of Aumyr. Its members respect order, but tend to see the world as a set of "right" and "wrong" things, even if often things do not stand this way. Because of their historical nature, they have always been in close contact with the Brotherhood. They have offices in the capitals and are well established in all regions of Aumyr.

### Normod

Normod is often depicted as a dark gray haired halfling. He was the mortal of the Five, depositary of the Magic Knowledge. His arts and abilities contributed to the creation of the first structures and constructions on Aumyr. He is also adored by the Order of Builders, as well as by the Order of Masters.

> Discipline forms character and makes the mind free. Discover the secrets of creation through the manipulation of the elements that make it up. Build your commitment on a solid foundation and cultivate love for all that is eternal and immutable.

#### Clerics of Normod

Although much of the clerical activity is dedicated to teaching, from the teachers of the Accademia Grigia in Fivestar, to the Custodes of Knowledge scattered throughout the villages and cities, very often the affiliates to the cult are also popularizers or itinerant adventurers. They can be driven by various motivations: the curiosity of exploration, the desire to protect their people or the desire to measure themselves against forces beyond their reach.

### Savas

Savas is represented as an androgynous and multiracial deity. In the group of Five, he was the leader and repository of wisdom. She is responsible for the cultural and ideological diversity of the people of Aumyr and is often worshipped by Druids, Wizards with elementary specializations, and in general charmers of both sexes. Some legends say that its continuous change of form was actually a curse.

> Your actions can be reasonable and measured. Excess and individuality lead to hatred, hatred to destruction, destruction to death. Share the change and you will follow its evolution.

#### Clerics of Savas

The teachings of the god are based on the balance between action and thought. Often the clerics of Savas have their own personal code of ethics, which is based on concepts of legality. It is not uncommon to find them in defense of small villages, where they can found a cohesive community, but it is easy to find them even in remote places in search of a deeper communion with their beliefs.

### Vel-Shar

Vel-Shar is the representation of the mad and reckless genius. Legend has it that his deadly arcane talent was the cause of many interplanar accidents and that even today part of his power is still sleeping in hidden crypts. Vel-Shar is the quintessence of destruction and deception. His followers, mostly chaotic, are divided into seniority bands according to the number of "harvests" (a kind of ritual sacrifice) and according to sex: priestesses play a fundamental role within the hierarchy of power of the temple, and are also called Daughters of Darkness, while males are called Reapers.

> Chaos is the only way to a more conscious understanding of oneself. Through instinct, talent and passion any obstacle can be overcome. Don't impose limits on your power, let it pervade so that you can rise above every living creature.

#### Clerics of Vel-Shar

The clerics of Vel-Shar do not share the creation of a vertical clerical structure, thinking instead that like their goddess, even the most insignificant individual, but devoted and capable, deserves respect. This philosophy, associated with the internal organizational and political aspect, constitutes the definition of Vel-Shar's will. Their horizontal structure allows a more agile (but always well defined) management of the roles covered by the followers. The females, sex of the goddess, are of great importance in this cult. Although only the initiates are aware of these mysteries, some argue that in reality the cult is only a cover for a gigantic and ancient sect of assassins headed by a supernatural entity. Even if they do not have a real center of worship, they can be found in numerous "shrines" scattered around Aumyr, some places in inaccessible places.

## The Native Gods

Native deities represent the dualism of the spirit of the world.
Their vision of creation is much deeper from the reasons for the deification of the Five and more and more followers begin this path of faith.

### Great Father

The Great Father is the personification of fatherhood. He protects the house, and he is the protector of Tradition. Often fairy tales full of meaning are told in order to pass on his creed. He is also the protector of the fighters, as well as of those who try to survive on their own strength.

> Defeat your enemies in the clamor of a battle, in the silence of a dark room or in the foliage of the forest. Hunt down the hunter, honour the prey. Your actions can speak for you.

#### Clerics of the Great Father

Coloro che desiderano diventare chierici devono porsi sotto le attenzioni di un precettore, solitamente un chierico anziano. Ottenere il grado di apprendista è un percorso iniziatico molto duro per la maggior parte di coloro che si vogliono sottoporre alle prove del credo. I meritevoli ottengono il rispetto e l’onore della loro tribù, se sono Nativi. Uno dei compiti del chierico del Grande Padre è preservare la Tradizione e gli antichi riti degli antenati, conoscenza che gli verrà tramandata una volta raggiunta la necessaria maturità per comprenderne i segreti.

### Great Mother

The Great Mother personifies motherhood. She is the ideal woman, the loving mother. Defender of the family, when it comes to children, she has a more direct impact than the Great Father on the most practical issues. She is the protector of the magical arts of the Natives, and is often invoked in times of need by wizards, sorcerers, clerics and charmers.

> Magic allows everything to be controlled and controlled. Through it we control and are controlled in an infinite play of light and shadow. Do not underestimate the power of a superior mind. Embrace every manifestation of life as part of magic itself.

#### Clerics of the Great Mother

The cult is strongly centered on the female figure. Priestesses are often young women with a strong, command-oriented personality. After a period of novitiate, an assembly of the eldest is called to elect the Matriarch. They know how to be patient and deserving of respect, but often also reckless and passionate. They do not hesitate to place the salvation of their loved ones above all else. When they decide to embark on a career as an adventurer, it is possible to find them engaged in spiritual research, or in interventions of justice.

## Divine Power

The kingdom of Aumyr is a land in turmoil, where many powers contend for part of the dominion over the Material Plan.
In addition to the Five, on Aumyr you can come across cults, sects and worshippers of many lesser known gods, but not completely ignored for this reason.
Gods rarely intervene in the events of the world, preferring to delegate some divine representatives.

### The Chosen Ones

The gods need worshippers to dispose of their divine status. It may happen that a deity names a creature, often a powerful adventurer, as the herald of his power in the world of mortals. In this case we speak of Chosen Beings. Each deity can nominate an unlimited number of Chosen Ones, who will ascend to the status of semi-deeds, and the Storyteller can decide the consequent powers and abilities dictated by this status.

### Becoming a God

On Aumyr ascending to the divine rank is sometimes considered a very real option. It is possible to aspire to the role of a god in case the previous divinity is challenged, destroyed or deprived of its faithful.
If you succeed in one of these feats, the area of influence of the deity will be transferred to the new bearer. As you can imagine, many adventurers and heroes aspire to this status, as well as enemies and creatures even darker and more mysterious.
However, achieving the status of world gods involves the balance of numerous powers. The other gods will always be jealous of their area of influence and will protect their domains in every possible way. Challenging the power of a deity is hardly ever an undertaking for mere mortals.

## Visions and Prophecies

In the lands of Aumyr, many rely on the gods as guides to their own destiny. Others order plots and conspiracies to control towns, cities and even entire regions, supported by lost or found riches and treasures. Aumyr's future is in the hands of anyone who can create their own place in the world. Many have heard stories and prophecies about the future at least once in their lives, consulting seers, oracles or old sages.

Here are some of these enigmatic prophecies about the future of the world:

- The Loner will see the light of the First Dawning Sun. He will be the new Voice of the Lady of the Night.

- As the Dragon Moon sets, many brave soldiers will finally find peace, but a new great plague will slip through the people.

- The Warrior and Priestess will unite in battle and forever in the heart of the world.

- The Power of the Magic Eye will be weakened and a new Order will rise to bring light to where darkness reigns.

- In the years when the Exile will become a God, The Queen will begin her Dark Kingdom.

- The new Astro will bring with it two future gifts: one material and one spiritual.

- Only when the Passage is opened again, will the former Race be able to return to claim the land.

- Everything is hidden for those who do not know where to look. Find the Secret Way when the Hunter becomes Prey.

- The powerful Red Snake will wake up during the Rites of Fire and the world will hear its unclean song again.

- A seed of hatred grows undisturbed in the place where the Beginning meets the End. Only with their union will the Champion rid the earth of perennial corruption.
