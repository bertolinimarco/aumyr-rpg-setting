# Dieties

Aumyr is a land full of magic, adventure, mystery and powerful heroes. Sometimes this power clashes with the plots and vicissitudes of the Gods: powerful beings ascended to a higher status of existence. Anyone on Aumyr can become a God, as long as he possesses worshippers and a high power to compete with that of the actual Gods. The road to immortality is full of obstacles and sacrifices, often too big and terrible.

## The Fives

In the year 2372 CE there are in total seven Gods recognized on Aumyr. Five of them represent the Five Travelers, the first to find themselves on the new planet, considered the most important divinities by all non-Natives. The other two remaining are the two Gods of the Natives, the inhabitants of the planet prior to the colonization of the Fives and the modern times.
Given the epic nature of the story of these Five Heroes, they were elected Gods of the world by the first colonizers, and acquired all the powers of this status.

### Hardon

Hardon is the quintessence of the warrior. Stubborn and devoted to a cause, he is the preferred God of Warriors and Paladins. He is often not considered the most wise, but troubles will find those who suffer his anger or treat his enemies. He is Melian's companion and tries to please her in every way, without knowing that he is prey to her continuous manipulation for her personal pleasure. Because of these special characteristics, the new fathers often invoke Hardon to protect their firstborn children.

> May the will guide you, Son. From swamps to mountain peaks, in the desert or in the ice, it may not be abandoned in difficult times, when you suffer or when you will be lost. May you defend yourself and find the way when it is hidden, to gain freedom

#### Clerics of Hardon

It is wrong to think that the clerics of Hardon lay the foundations of worship on the adoration of physical strength. The doctrine finds many interpretations among the various worshippers. There are those who think that strength comes from experience and wisdom, rather than from battle skills. Usually a Hardon cleric is still a warrior. Whether it fights elegantly or brutally, the will of a Hardon worshipper is difficult to break and are often considered among the best prepared clerics in situations where confrontation is the only possibility of salvation.

### Melian

Melian is the wife of Hardon. Equipped with a shifting personality, sometimes manipulator, sometimes incredibly generous, it is often depicted as an attractive elf. In the group of Fives, she possessed divine powers, which led her Worship to be one of the most adored by healers and clerics.

> Chaos leads to Destruction. Just as the veil separates the kingdom of the living from that of the dead, so a soul must be able to surrender to natural laws, as depositories of true equilibrium. Help preserve life, and you will save much more than yourself

#### Clerics of Melian

The Cult of Melian grew up over the centuries as the largest clerical institution of Aumyr. Its members respect order, but tend to see the world as a set of "right" and "wrong" things, even if things are often not in this way. Given their historical nature, I have always been in close contact with the Council. They have offices between the capitals and are well established in all regions of Aumyr.

### Normod

Normod is often depicted as a half-man with dark grey hair. He was the mortal of the Five Depositories of Magic Knowledge. His arts and skills have contributed to the creation of the first structures and constructions on Aumyr. He is also adored by the Order of Builders, as well as by the Order of Wise Men.

> Discipline forms character and frees the mind. Discover the secrets of creation by manipulating the elements that compose it. Build your commitment on solid foundations and cultivate love for all that is eternal and immutable

#### Clerics of Normod

Although much of the clerical activity is dedicated to teaching, from the teachers of the Grey Academy in Fivestar, to the Wisdom scattered throughout villages and cities, very often cult affiliates are also local authorities or itinerant adventurers. They can be driven by various motivations: the curiosity of exploration, the desire to protect their own people or the willingness to measure thyself against forces beyond their reach.

### Savas

Savas is represented as an androgynous and multiracial deity. In the Group of Fives, it had the role of leader and depositary of wisdom. It is responsible for the cultural and ideological diversity of the people of Aumyr and is often worshipped by Druids, Wizards with elemental specializations, and in general sorcerers of both sexes. Some legends claim that its continuous change of form was actually a curse.

> Your actions can be reasonable and well measured. Excess and individuality lead to hatred, hatred to destruction, destruction to death. Embrace the change and follow its evolution

#### Clerics of Savas

God's teachings are based on a balance between action and thought. Savas clerics often have their own personal code of ethics, which is based on concepts of legality and balance. It is not uncommon to find them in defense of small villages, where they can found a cohesive community, but it is easy to find them even in remote places in search of a deeper communion with their beliefs.

### Vel-Shar

Vel-Shar is the representation of the boundless and reckless genius. The legend tells that her deadly and mysterious powers was the cause of many interplanar incidents and that even today part of her power is still sleeping in hidden crypts. Vel-Shar is the quintessence of destruction and deception. His followers, mostly chaotic, are divided into seniority groups according to the number of "harvests" (a sort of ritual sacrifice) and on the basis of sex: priestesses play a fundamental role within the hierarchy of power of the temple, and are also called "Daughters of Darkness", while males are called "Harvesters".

> Chaos is the only way to a more conscious understanding of oneself. Through instinct, talent and passion any obstacles can be overcome. Do not impose limits on your power, let it pervade so that you can rise above every living creature

#### Clerics of Vel-Shar

The clerics of Vel-Shar do not share the creation of a vertical power structure, thinking instead, as their goddess, even the most insignificant individual but proven to be devoted and capable, deserves respect. This philosophy, combined with the organizational and internal political aspect, is the definition of "Vel-Shar's Wish". Their horizontal structure allows for a more flexible (but always well-defined) management of the roles covered by the followers. Females, representing the sex of the goddess, are very important in this cult. Although only the initiates are aware of these mysteries, some claim that worship is actually only a coverage for a giant and ancient sect of Assassins headed by a supernatural entity. Even if they do not have a true centre of worship, they can be found in numerous "Sanctuaries" scattered around Aumyr, some of them in inaccessible places.

## The Native Gods

Native Gods represent the dualism of the spirit of the world. Their vision of creation is far more profound from the reasons for the divinization of the Fives, and every day new followers begin this path of faith.

### Great Father

The Great Father is the personification of fatherhood. He protects the house, and he's the protector of Tradition. Often talked about tales full of meanings to pass on his beliefs. He is also the protector of fighters, as well as of those who try to survive by counting on their own strengths.

> Defeat your enemies in the hustle and bustle of a battle, in the silence of a dark room or among the forest fronds. Hunting the hunter, honor the prey. Your actions can speak for you.

#### Clerics of Great Father

Those who wish to become clerics must be placed under the care of a tutor, usually an elder or senior cleric. Achieving the degree of apprentice is a very hard initiatory path for most of those who want to undergo the tests of belief. The deserving ones get the respect and honor of their tribe, if they are Native. One of the tasks of the cleric of the Great Father is to preserve the Tradition and ancient rites of his ancestors, knowledge that will be handed down to him once he has reached the necessary maturity to understand his secrets.

### Great Mother

The Great Mother personifies motherhood. She is the ideal woman, the loving mother. Defender of the family, when it comes to children, it has a more direct impact than the Grand Father on the most practical questions. She is the protector of the magical arts of the Native, and is often invoked in times of need by wizards, sorcerers, clerics and enchanters.

> Magic allows everything to be controlled and controlled. Through it we control and are controlled in an infinite play of light and shadow. Do not underestimate the power of a higher mind. It embraces every manifestation of life as part of magic itself

#### Clerics of Great Mother

The cult is strongly centered on the female figure. Clerics are young women with a strong, emphatic and leadership personality. They know to be patient and worthy of respect, but also they're often reckless and passionate. They do not hesitate to put the salvation of their loved ones above all else. When they decide to embark on an adventurous career, you can find them engaged in spiritual research or justice interventions.

## Divine Power

The world of Aumyr is a land in turmoil, where many powers contend for part of the dominion over the Material Plane.
In addition to the Fives, on Aumyr you can come across cults, sects and worshippers of many lesser-known divinities, but not completely ignored. Gods rarely intervene in the events of the world, preferring to delegate some divine representatives.

### The Chosens

The gods need worshippers to maintain their divine status. Sometimes a God nominates a creature, often a powerful adventurer, as herald of his power in the mortal world. In this case, we speak of Chosen beings. Each God can nominate an unlimited number of Chosens, who will ascend to the status of semi-divnity, and the DM it's able to decide about the powers and abilities derived from this status.

### Becoming a God

On Aumyr ascending to the divine rank is considered a very real option. It is possible to aspire to the role of a God if the previous divinity is challenged, destroyed or deprived of its worshippers. In the event of success in one of these events, the area of influence of the old God will be transferred to the new God. As you can easily imagine, many adventurers and heroes aspire to ascend to this status, as well as even more obscure and mysterious enemies and creatures.
However, achieving the status of divinity of the world involves the balance of numerous powers. The other Gods will always be jealous of their area of influence and will protect their domains in every possible way. Challenging the power of a divinity is almost never an easy task for a simple mortal.

## Visions and Prophecies

In the lands of Aumyr, many rely on the Gods as guides for their destiny. Others create plots and conspiracies to control towns, cities and even entire regions, backed up by lost or rediscovered treasures and artifacts from a obscure and mysterious past. Aumyr's future lies in the hands of anyone who is able to create their own place in the world. Many are those who, at least once in their lives, have heard stories and prophecies about the future, consulting seers, oracles or sages.

Here are some of these enigmatic prophecies about the future of the world:

- The Solitaire will see the light of the First rising Sun. He will be the new voice of the Lady of the Night.

- At the fall of the Dragon's Moon, many brave soldiers will finally find peace, but a new great scourge will slip among the people

- The warrior and the priestess will unite in battle and eternal, in the heart of the world

- The Power of the Magic Eye will be weakened and a new Order will rise to bring light where darkness reigns.

- In the years in which the Exiled will become a God, the Queen will begin her Dark Kingdom

- The new Star will bring with it two future gifts: a material one, and a spiritual one

- Only when the Passage is opened again will the breed that was once upon a time be able to return to claim the land

- Everything is hidden for those who do not know where to look. Find the Secret Way when the Hunter becomes the Prey

- The powerful Red Snake will wake up during the Rites of Fire and the world will hear his unspeakable song again

- A seed of hatred grows undisturbed in the place where the beginning meets the End. Only with their union will the Champion wield the earth from eternal corruption
