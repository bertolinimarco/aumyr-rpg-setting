# Chronology

Most of the historical information is written by the Council and kept within the White Hand Library in Fivestar.
The chronology in this manual covers events from the discovery of the world to 2372 CE, a new era of discovery and adventure. The DM may consult the following chronology in order to identify potential hooks or narrative solutions for his gaming sessions.

## Eras

The Council has established rules for the computation of years, seasons and all measurements, nominal and official conventions of Aumyr. Each year is divided into 12 months and each month has 30 days.

To standardize the computation of years, months and days of the week do not have an official name and adopt a cardinal numbering, even if many regions use their own secondary calendar. A written example of an extended date could then be defined as follows:

> 3/10/2370 CE
> (or Third Day of the Tenth Month of the Year 2370, Common Era)
