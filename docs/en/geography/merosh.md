# Merosh

![Banner](/images/banner-merosh.png)

A set of mountain ranges overlooking a gulf of plains and hills. The region encompasses the entire territory between the Hills of Thomulard to the West and the Caravan's Way to the East. Merosh is divided in the middle by a chain of mountains that cuts the whole area obliquely. The Lovers' Falls are of great importance, a place that is even represented on the regional standard.

## Government

Composed of a parliament made up of politicians and representatives of various races and cultures, the government of Merosh is an elected democracy. However, this system of government is not well seen by the population, deceived by years of internal political struggles between their representatives. People of mistrust often try to circumvent rules and laws by adopting their own modus operandi, which is not always in conformity with safety and general morality. Some people barricade themselves at home and protect at the cost of their lives everything they possess from brigands, criminals and wandering monsters, others take advantage of bureaucratic chaos to settle at the head of large commercial realities, or plot their rise to power in the shadow of politics.

## War

Merosh has a government army that is directly accountable to Parliament's decisions. Soldiers, made up of professional warriors, make up a great military force that is potentially able to maintain peace between villages. The army is, however, an expensive and clumsy organ, slowed down by endless bureaucracy under the control of Parliament. In times of war, the Parliament appoints a Military General and two Councilors, the latter chosen, according to the needs, from among the ranks of the Sons of Hardon or the Red Brotherhood.

## Population

The population of Merosh is divided, like its territory. However, a large part of them deal with trade, especially around the capital. The others are scattered throughout the region and occupations may vary from agriculture to hunting, from the production of fine pottery (especially to be exported) to the forging of weapons. Because of the fact that hills, plains and mountains coexist in the territory at short distances, the area is also a destination for alchemists and wanderings, determined to find rare ingredients for alchemical potions and rituals.

## Religion

All Gods are worshiped in Merosh, but only recently the Parliament has begun investigations because of a progressive increase in underground cults linked to chaos and destruction domains.

## Capitals

### Veloras

![Veloras](/images/map-veloras-en.jpg)

Entering Veloras via the wide foothill road, you get the impression that you are in one of the most beautiful places in the region. The view of the Falls, omnipresent for those who travel along the road climbing towards the city centre, is astonishing and the entire landscape seems to be a painting just designed by a talented artist. The city is often punctuated by small kiosks and many visitors: commercial activities compete on how to get extra coins from the next customer. Crime is rampant, especially in the west of the coast, despite the fact that the city guard is constantly monitoring.

#### History

- [24 CE](../chronology/#_24-ce) Finding the Chronicles of the Wizard, a series of notes from a sorcerer determined to build his own house in the mountains. He indicates that he has settled near an ancient stone temple guarding a mysterious source of water.

- [204 CE](../chronology/#_204-ce) The Chronicles of the Wizard report how on this date the territory is destroyed by a powerful spell that erodes much of the coast inland. This incident will cause the formation of Spirits Islands.

- [206 CE](../chronology/#_206-ce) A group of explorers settled in the area, founding the city. They are thought to have been scholars, because of the amount of historical information about the region that has been handed down through parchments that have remained intact until today.

- [1983 CE](../chronology/#_1983-ce) Date of the probable Tragedy of the Lovers, a legend of Merosh that tells of betrayal and revenge. From these stories, local beliefs will be formed that will lead the city to become known as the City of Lovers.

#### Districts

##### Spirit Islands

It is a group of islands high enough to be reached only by a system of footbridges above the town cove, unless you climb a rock face several meters high, overhanging the winding waters of the cove.

##### Hill of the Arts

This hill is inhabited mainly by wizards and enchanters: almost all the houses are magically protected. In the "magic quarter" some offer their services with a shop on the ground floor, others prefer to remain isolated in study, meditation or contemplation.

##### Ravenmount

This dark neighborhood is where the city's illicit business is concentrated. It's full of oily taverns, moldy shops, pungent smells, not to mention the ever-present noise of the nearby waterfalls. The people of Montecorvo are hostile to adventurers and often try to deceive foreigners by selling them junk, cursed objects or powerful poisons disguised as normal healing potions.

#### Points of Interest

##### Parliament

A simple, pentagonal palace stands out on one of the islands. It is the seat of the government and in its rooms you can find messengers, politicians, historians, wise men and experts. Much of the controversy in the region is resolved in these austere rooms, often the scene of heated political and ethical clashes. The collection of the Chronicles of the Wizard is kept in an underground area.

##### Temple of the Source

The presence of this area is reported before the construction of the city. Today it is possible to admire a temple decorated with aquamarine and limestone, with numerous bas-reliefs depicting several divinities. Once a year, it is a place of pilgrimage for a congregation of magicians who believe that the fountain holds great power.

##### Lovers Square

In the south-west part of the city you can admire this unique area. A large stone mosaic forms a rotating figure of two spirits that contrast in a circle. All over the square there is a powerful magic that increases the charism, personal magnetism and self-confidence. Given this power, many people are in this area in search of great love.

##### Jumping Tavern

A wrecked structure located on the piece of land closest to the waterfalls, the inn is famous for its strong liqueurs and its dangerous location. Paying a toll, as a test of courage it is possible to try to cross a network of invisible walkways on the back of the tavern. The path is very dangerous and full of traps, also invisible, which can be overcome only thanks to spells of divination or pure skill.

##### Oracle Tower

This is a strange pagoda, closed to the public. The people of Merosh think that it's the home of a solitary seer. Every now and then it seems possible to glimpse a red foliage through the slits of the tower, and it is said that a presence always responds to the requests of those who can contact it, even if many people believe that it is only a setup to attract new visitors.

## Dungeons

### Lovers Falls

Almost obligatory stop during the visit of the region, the Falls are a natural spectacle that has contributed to the fame of the region, as well as its standard. It is said, however, that they are not only a place for tourists, but that there is a passage through several rooms and levels of a dungeon-temple where the spirit of a mad widow from another world cries for eternity, waiting for the return of his lost lover.

### Cave of Bones

It is believed that in the past these natural caves have been used by the Native people as a place of prayer and burial. Today the caves are an underground complex of alcoves and small ravines adorned with skulls and bones. The area is often controlled by the Red Brotherhood, especially to preserve its structure and history.

## Hills

### Thomulard Hills

Large hilly area to the west of the region, owes its name to a certain "Thomulard the Dreamer". Growing up in a nearby village, where he had spent a dangerous and carefree childhood, Thomulard left one day in the wild hills to the west claiming he wanted to build his "ideal city". One summer morning, the villagers watched him set off on foot armed with only a pickaxe and a backpack of supplies. He was declared dead three days later.

### Greymantle Hills

It is a road route that connects the city of Veloras with the Hills of Thomulard. Over the years the road has undergone some variations in route due to the hilly nature of this area, which often forced the caravans to attempt longer and less safe roads, to prevent the wheels of the wagons from breaking under the uneven stone. As if that were not enough, the area is often the scene of attacks by bandits and criminal outposts.

## Mountains

### Winds Pass

Also known as the "White Trail", the pass is a small road that climbs up through the mountains, with the aim of offering a faster passage that is not along the mountains. Thanks to the efforts of the Wolfguard, the pass is relatively safe even if, given the presence of numerous icy air currents from the surrounding peaks, it is not advisable to pass through with a heavy or large load.

## Plains

### Plains of Rest

The area is a large part of the centre of Merosh: a flat, sometimes marshy terrain dotted with sparse green trees and farmland scattered among cultivated fields. In the middle of the plains, you can stop under one of the Millenary Trees, a unique group of evergreen trees with such a large trunk whose rings suggest that an age too old for a normal tree is too advanced. A local legend has it that the God Normod himself stopped between the foliage of these trees during his travels.
