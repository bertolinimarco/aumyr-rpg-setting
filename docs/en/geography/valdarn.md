# Valdarn

![Banner](/images/banner-valdarn.png)

The Valdarn Region is known as "everything that lies between the Jaws and the Mountains", that is to say a large hilly territory, if its borders and the Snake's Back are excluded. Valdarn is famous for its mineral deposits, the pride of its people (maybe the legacy of trade with Nordavind) and the beauty of its landscapes. Almost all the greatest adventurers have been somehow attracted by the mines to the north of the region, where the ruins of ancient Zimara can also be found.

## Government

Valdarn has always gone through internal wars due to the fact that it is the region with the largest number of mineral mines on the continent. This has allowed rich merchants, evil masters and other figures to emerge from the people and gain power. After numerous dictatorships and oligarchies of a commercial nature, the region seems to have recovered much of its democracy through a series of trade control campaigns. Although at the moment Valdarn is led by a group of democratic elected merchants, all under the strict control of the Council, someone says that the region is one of the key points of power of the Mercatus.

## War

The armies of Valdarn, initially under the same control of the Council, have been replaced over time by mercenaries or other soldiers of fortune, so that anyone in government could exercise their power without the constant control of the Council. They also form the region's army in the event of war and are very well paid for their experience in battle.

## Population

The people of Valdarn have a heart hard as the stone of the mountains itself, however even the concept of family nucleus is held in high regard. The profession of jeweler or stone carver is one of the highest expressions of the culture of the region. Here, skillful hands manage to shape the stone as if it were clay, giving fantastic shapes to jewels and brilliant treasures.

## Religion

In Valdarn, the Five are adored, but also and above all the Great Father, for his influence in trade and commerce. It is not uncommon to find temples dedicated to Normod, or altars dedicated to some stone divinities, on the impassable paths of the mountains.

## Capitals

### Brean

![Brean](/images/map-brean.jpg)

The city of Brean is also clearly visible from great distances, given its high Celestial Tower. This structure represents the government center of the region and the various internal levels host the heart of the Merchants administration. The town houses are built using a particular stone with greenish shades, obtained from the Emerald Mountains. The city's appearance at sunset is a twisting of colors and lights that inspires a sense of wonder and tranquility to the visitor. Almost everyone in the city has been involved in the trade of stones from an early age, from extraction to transformation into excellent gemstones. The numerous artisan workshops in the city are often family business, since art is transmitted mainly to the family.

#### History

- [240 CE](../chronology/#_240-ce) Brean is founded by a group of adventurers, using the many riches extracted from the nearby Emerald Mountains.

- [900 CE](../chronology/#_900-ce) A dwarf invasion begins that will hold the city under siege for 5 years. The dwarfs of the Emerald Mountains, led by Wortus Malagar, take possession of the city by digging tunnels and entering from underground. Their objective is to bring back to the Mountains the riches stolen in decades of looting by adventurers and criminals.

#### Districts

##### Carvers District

It contains most of the city's commercial activities, taverns and refreshments. In its numerous side streets you can see the famous carvers of Brean at work, intent in their work outside their small shops. In this area it is also possible to find the town centre, formed by stone constructions with emerald melted stone coming from the nearby mountains. It is not uncommon for some adventurers to pick stones to refine them and try to make some money, even if the area is guarded day and night.

##### Seeker Quarters

It is a multitude of houses and dwellings built around the old town centre. It is the place where the less wealthy population is located, made up of slums, mercenary barracks and minor guilds. Some shops sell cheaply jewelry of low value, to look for easy currency suitable to survive the standard of living of the richest neighborhoods.

##### The Long Walk

The long uphill road that leads to the Celestial Tower is the true heart of the city. Here you can find the best merchants and attractions for adventurers or passing people. On the sides of the street there are always open markets, temples, libraries, shops selling magical objects, alchemists, gunsmiths, bards, theatre shows, travelling parties, and many other activities.

#### Points of Interest

##### Celestial Tower

A distinctive symbol of the city, the Celestial Tower is visible from several kilometers away in the surrounding plains and is a true masterpiece of architecture and engineering. It houses the government of the region and its various rooms contain rarities and precious objects of all kinds. Entrance to the top floors of the Heavenly Tower is forbidden, except for Merchants. The entire structure is so shrouded in mystery that it is said that there is a secret room at the top of it that contains an ancient Askari portal.

##### Forge of Wonders

It is a shop of magical objects, built around the only Askari Forge ever found. The shop is famous for buying and selling rare and powerful items, you can find or order almost any weapon or armor, as long as you own enough money to pay the master blacksmiths who work there.

##### Stone Park

So called because of the numerous white stone statues scattered throughout its greatness, the city park is an oasis of tranquility far from the chaos of the streets of the gem carvers. The whole area is like a giant book of stories: the statues represent gods, heroes, monsters, animals and other bizarre stories.

##### The Cornerstone

It is the largest gaming house on the continent. A huge multicolored dome on the top of The Long Walk, which also serves as an entrance door to the Heavenly Tower. Inside there are sumptuous rooms dedicated to the economic entertainment of merchants and wealthy customers looking for luck.

##### House of Eternal Sighs

This dilapidated structure is famous throughout the region for being one of the most unique places and infested with spirits you know. An ancient house of pleasure, the structure is now a sinister place: it is said to have many rooms with areas of dead magic, and given its importance is supervised by the Sleep Monks, which also uses it for teaching purposes for spiritual activities and supernatural knowledge.

## Cities

### Daxxos

The large outpost on the Jaws is made up of ferrous earth platforms connected by energy bridges, magically suspended over natural geysers and acid ponds. It is a very dangerous place and not a few have died by falling from its self-propelled hills. The whole territory is crossed by strong bursts of acid wind that corrodes stone, houses and fabrics of all kinds in a few years, making it very difficult to live in this place for a long time. Due to the extreme nature of this place, little surveillance can be found by both the local government and the Council, which allows the flourishing of illicit trade and black market.

## Mountains

### Jaws of Orne

Complex of active mountains and volcanoes, magmatic springs and surface geysers, the Jaws of Orne are one of the most unique places in Aumyr. The sages think that the earth plates underneath the surface push the entire western part of the region to the north. Nobody can venture safely into this area, given the very high possibility of being asphyxiated by geysers or destroyed in large pools of acid.

## Hills

### Sandmarsh Hills

The vast hilly region known as Sandmarsh is protected from the sun almost all year round and is usually little frequented by caravans or other groups of merchants, who prefer to take a longer but also safer route. Here you will find many clans of orcs or trolls or other wild creatures, ruined outposts and ghost villages.

## Islands

### Bariaur

Bariaur, otherwise known as "Forest Island" is located north of the village of Cynosur. On the island you can find a peculiar settlement of Natives, avoided by the population of the mainland for their extremely wild and ancestral heritage. Fishermen report how they live as cannibals, eating their own kind, and living in huts created with the skins of their ancestors. The island is so small that this savage population does not create any problems for the people of the continent.

## Temples

### Talking Stones

This complex of megalithic stones could be an ancient temple or some building dating back to pre-colonization years. Wizards and researchers have tried for years to understand the meaning of stones, without results. The place's name is derived from the fact that some people seem to hear some voices coming from stones, voices that sometimes seem whispering and others seem to be dense speeches of meaning.
