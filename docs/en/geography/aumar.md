# Aumar

![Banner](/images/banner-aumar.png)

Aumar It is a large region that includes vast green plains, pastures, rivers and large lakes.
Aumar is a land dotted with lush flora and fauna, cultivated fields and green hills. A magical place of peace and tranquility. It is possible to walk along roads and paths to the heart of its forests and people are very tolerant of foreigners visiting its landscapes. Although the place represents in a certain sense "the Great Green Garden of Aumyr", there are many dangers lurking in its endless fields.

## Government

Federalist democracy. The heads of individual villages and cities meet annually in Atanis to discuss politics and harvesting, war and arts, under the control of a representative appointed by the Council (usually a high-ranking charmer) who does not have decision-making powers but only control, so as to prevent one of the leaders from attempting a coup d' état. The region is so keenly committed to its independence from external controls that the Council's interference is never seen favorably by the population.

## War

The region does not have an organized army or a battle plan that prepares the population for a potential conflict: in the event of an attack, males, be they peasants or blacksmiths, potters or actual soldiers, form the bulk of the army; women, children and elderly people who cannot fight tend to retreat into the depths of the Forest of Voice. In the past, the ancient forest took on the role of safe haven for the population of nearby towns and villages: even today it is still possible to come across some hidden outpost or remains of past settlements, surrounded by climbing and the vault of large trees.

## Population

Due to the conformation of the territory, the population of Aumar is mainly dedicated to agriculture, pastoral and other rural activities. Many landowners are wealthy thanks to the rich land in the region, which provides for the needs of about half of the continent in terms of meat, cereals and wheat supply.

## Religion

Although temples of every divinity can be found in Atanis and in cities, the majority of the population adores Savas and Melian, because of their influence on daily life, harvest and the cyclicality of existence. On the other hand, there are rare cults dedicated to chaos and decadence: it is said that Vel-Shar has little influence in this region, but some testimonies of hidden sanctuaries dedicated to her seem to deny these beliefs.

## Capitals

### Atanis

![Atanis](/images/map-atanis-en.jpg)

The capital is situated on a small hilly area in the middle of a river crossroads, where the Ator River and the Mor River form the Great River. It consists of a myriad of small wooden and stone houses and almost all the inhabitants own a small piece of land adjacent to their home. The population dedicates itself almost completely to peasant activities and every year there are numerous fairs dedicated to the celebration of agricultural activities. This does not prevent Atanis from being the cultural centre of an entire region, with numerous temples and commercial activities overlooking the surrounding plains.

#### History

- [62 EC](../chronology/#_62-ec) Atanis is founded by an alliance of landowners, descendants of the first to settle in the confluence area between the three rivers.

- [1710 EC](../chronology/#_1710-ec) Over the years and under the strict guidance of some elderly people, the city has grown to become one of the largest exporters of wheat, cheese, meat and livestock. The great power of landowners is consolidated and gaps soon arise between those who cultivate the land and those who own it.

- [1820 EC](../chronology/#_1820-ec) During numerous clashes, most of the old owners die or are killed. Many people suspect that the Council is an integral part of the conspiracy aimed at ousting the old government in favor of a democratic or non oligarchic alternative.

- [1956 EC](../chronology/#_1956-ec) The northern part of the city, originally home to the dwellings of the opulent landowners, was demolished and then sold to the population, becoming the "People's Lands". The heads of the surrounding cities come together to form a federal government, created to represent the entire population of the region equitably.

### Districts

#### People's Land

The lands in the northern part of the city are assigned to the poor, the poor and all those who need subsistence through peasant activity. Usually, the problems are about drunken drunkenness and other minor crimes, as there is not much to steal in this area.

#### Harvest District

This area is the center of agricultural and industrial activities in the region: each farmer is required to prepare the tithes to be paid to the city and in every place where you can see wagons full of goods towed through the streets covered with straw.

#### The Two Springs

It is the district of the new nobles and the rich of the area. It is called this because of the particular beauty of its streets and houses: those who live there feel that spring lasts longer than usual, while enjoying the surrounding landscape or cultivating their own field in the shade of large villas with flowering gardens. In this part of the city there are also most temples dedicated to Gods.

#### Point of Interest

#### Crossroads Island

The name of this small piece of land derives from the point of confluence of the River Mor and the River Ator. The island is little more than one point of passage, except in the case of a federal council, where it is closed to the public for the duration of the meeting. In this case, the two access points are closed and guarded.

#### Great Granary

It is a solid, reinforced magical wood construction that acts as a warehouse for taxes and tithes imposed by the federal government. The structure extends for several meters above the surrounding land, dominating the entire southern part of the city.

#### Sun Square

A large piece of yellowish and very fine land, very similar to coastal sand, is the largest square in town. It is thought that in the past this area was subject to a "reclamation" by some powerful spells, even if no one remembers precisely the reasons. It is now home to the city market, events, rallies and much more.

#### Sunset Hill

The people of Aumar believe that through cremation the spirit reaches the peace of the gods in a more complete way, free from the burden of a mortal body. The hill is the place where the bodies of the inhabitants of the capital are created. For these reasons, a garrison of the Red Brotherhood is permanently stationed in Greymanor.

#### Greymanor

Before the uprisings that saw the people rebellion against the old landowners, Greymanor was the center of organizational activity and economic power of the region. Now the structure is a huge mansion of stone converted into barracks, forges, lodgings, kitchens and other spaces dedicated to the representatives of the Council and the Red Brotherhood.

## Cities

### Erth

This city is built around a magical fountain that also serves as a source for the River Mor. The source is so pure that the vegetation that grows at the edge of the river is almost entirely edible or in any case usable for alchemy or healing potions.

### Gamaran

It is also called The Upper Town, given its rather elevated location. Originally used to act as a frontier outpost, and today the town is famous for its numerous terraces from where you can see all the Plains of Eldeen on sunny days.

### Lakeside

Originally little more than a village on a dangerous marshland, Lakeside has recently undergone major structural and magical interventions to reclaim unstable foundations and create building land.

### Lamòra

Built on the edge of the Great River, Lamòra is a major centre for trade and river transport. For a few coins you can take advantage of one of the many fishing boats to cross the river, or follow the calm waters up to Orros Bridge.

### Oldcross

Destroyed and reconstructed several times, Oldcross is often raided by wild creatures from nearby Thomulard Hills. In recent times the Council has set up a select group of warrior magicians able to use force camps and other defensive spells.

## Forests

### Forest of the Voice

It is a large forest that occupies almost the whole western part of the region. The modern name "della Voce" derives from the fact that many merchants walking along the internal paths swear to hear voices and whispers come from every direction as they enter the depths of the forest.

### Bel-Vor Clearing

This barren area north of the forest is one of the few points in the region completely devoid of vegetation. The land is barren and the area is hundreds of meters wide. Only the oldest druids in the forest could know the history of this particular area.

## Lakes

### Lake Magmoor

It is used as a source of water for the numerous pastures in the endless Plains of Eldeen. There are no permanent settlements but it is often a stopover for caravans.

### Lake Meras

If you enter the Forest of the Voice from the East, soon almost all paths will soon lead you to the shores of the great Lake Meras. Its dark and cool waters allow a cool climate in the surrounding area even in the middle of summer and make the whole lake a destination for many animals and other creatures that find refreshment on its banks.

### Lake Thun

Someone claims that the waters of Lake Thun have increased in level since the reclamation of the village of Lakeside, which means that this small natural lake is also one of the deepest in the region. It's fishless, it is thought that the bottom of this natural pit dwells some mysterious creature.
