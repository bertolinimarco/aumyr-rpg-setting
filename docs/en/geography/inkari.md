# Inkari

![Banner](/images/banner-inkari.png)

This great island is the place where the Native people landed after fleeing from the continent in the era of rebirth.
The flora and fauna of the area has evolved slightly differently from that of the continent. Many people consider Inkari to be a true independent continent. One of the many peculiarities of the region is the presence of two Capitals.

## Government

The dual nature of the Inkari territory also makes the type of government twofold. In Khoralis there is the Great Father's Worship, a sort of elective monarchy formed by an elderly male who has shown wisdom and knowledge throughout his life. Meentum is instead governed by a Matriarchy, an elite elite of strong women who hold power in whirlwind political struggles and intrigue.

## War

The region does not have a real organised army. Over the centuries of isolation from the continent, few threats have attempted to corrupt the island, except for the frequent internal struggles between tribes. In the event of an attack, however, it is a tradition to set up a Grand Council formed by the Regnant of Khoralis and the Matriarchs of Meentum, an organ with maximum powers of war and religious decision making.

## Population

The first explorers of the Dorne Society who landed on the island of Inkari determined to discover its history and culture, bring back social structures derived from a religious cult of tribal style. It seems that society divides the population into different groups or "Caste" according to sex, innate or unborn magical knowledge, and other psycho-attitudinal characteristics. It is not clear whether these castes are fixed (a warrior can never become a sorcerer) or mobile (in the case of adoptions of abandoned children in a new household, for example). Much depends on the traditions and decisions of the Regent (in Khoralis) or Matriarchs (in Meentum).

## Religion

Religion plays an important and complex role in the Natives society, profoundly influencing daily life and thought. Even if it is a diversified theology and a spiritualist theology, two main cults can be distinguished: that of the Great Father and that of the Great Mother. The whole system is of a dualistic type: the first represents concepts of exteriority, strength, physical, materiality, ability; while the second represents interiority, wisdom, mind, spirituality, magic. The sacred texts on which the religious system is based are known as Tradition and Knowledge, an archive of parchments, books and relics preserved in the libraries of Meentum.

## Capitals

### Khoralis

![Kaphnur](/images/map-khoralis-en.jpg)

It is the city dedicated to the Great Father, situated on a spur of meteoric rock in the northern part of the island. It looks like an apparent cluster of houses on top of each other, but in truth it's an ingenious design that allows many inhabitants to share the city's basic resources while avoiding waste as much as possible. The central part of the city, also known as "Circhio della Forza", is of great importance: a public area where anyone can put an end to different disputes, challenging another citizen in a deadly fight. It is a very common practice during struggles for possessions, inheritances, family affairs, tribal, punishment, revenge and similar.

#### History

- [344 AE](../chronology/#_344-ae) An apocalyptic rain of meteorites devastates the area, destroying much of the territory and transforming it into a strange landscape from the low hills. After a hundred years the soil will have changed: the land will be fertile and luxuriant, hard but also particularly malleable.

- [192 CE](../chronology/#_192-ce) The blind Regent Tar-Alund, called "the Prophet", gets a vision on a new moon night: it is the arrival of the Fives on Aumyr and the beginning of a new era for the natives.

- [20 CE](../chronology/#_20-ce) Some native explorers report about strange visitors and understand the true meaning of Tar-Alund's prophecy. The Regents begin to train warrior troops with the aim of preserving and defending the island from any external invasions.

- [75 CE](../chronology/#_75-ce) An expedition of elves, humans, dwarves and halflings lands in the village of Jundarai. It is only a matter of time before they come to Khoralis and discover the natives and their ancient civilization. Since then, the capital's structure has remained almost unchanged, even if today it is home to many different races.

### Districts

#### Circle of Strenght

The central area of the city is a place used as a public arena, square, court, court, theatre, venue for shows and challenges. It is the centre of the city's activity, considering that all events of public and private order are disputed here, under the divine eyes of the Great Father. Every year, the young warriors celebrate the conclusion of the ritual of passage into adulthood, becoming warriors of the clan to all intents and purposes.

#### Sages Hills

It is a green area full of graves and monuments of rough stone. The area is considered both a graveyard and a temple and the land is sacred. A place with multiple functions, the oracles of the ancestors are consulted among the tombs, in search of advice or inspiration for the future. It is said that some restless spirits also wander through the monuments, whispering ancient curses to visitors and prompting them to practice ritual suicides.

#### Crypts of the Tradition

The western ridge of Khoralis is a maze of catacombs and crypts, some of which are ancient for millennia. They are a place of neutrality: both ancient Regents and simple warriors are buried in the same catacombs, symbolizing equity and equality in the inevitable moment of death. There are many religious services and blessing rites that are celebrated daily between these underground corridors from the low vaulted ceiling, and make the place relatively safe, although it's easy to get lost in its dark mazes.

### Points of interest

#### Temple of the Great Father

A large stone building with a wooden roof overlooking the capital, the center of worship of the Great Father is also the home of many great priests and paladins. He performs both a religious and military function, serving as a barracks and reference point for the training of all those who are devoted to the divinity. A large brazier in the middle of the temple symbolizes ardour and tenacity.

#### The Crater

Built on a singular terrain, formed after the fall of a meteor in remote times, the Crater is the largest tavern in the city, always a refuge of adventurers, bards, mercenaries and criminals. The architecture of the site is influenced by strong influences from outside the island of Inkari, making frequent brawls that often lead patrons to the Circle of Strenght. The owner of the inn is convinced that sooner or later another swarm of meteors will hit the area destroying everything.

#### Burning Well

It is an old well, now sealed, located between two small lakes in the northern part of the city. It is said to have descended several hundred meters down to a complex of caves filled with the same meteoric rock that plunged into this area in the Ancient Era. The air on the bottom is unbreathable due to toxic vapors, acid pools and hot magma rivers. Numerous adventurers have descended into its depths, but apart from the magnificent underground grotto full of crystals, it seems that the cavity is empty.

#### The Dragon Throne

It is said that a native Regent of the past times had the ability to ride and command the dragons in battle. Today this structure is only a pale memory of the splendor of the past: it is formed by a circular mausoleum placed on the top of a hill, inside it is still possible to sit on the remains of a stone throne shaped like a dragon's head. It is often visited by religious groups, historians and elderly nostalgic warriors.

#### The Eternal Forge

This small shop is owned by an elderly blacksmith. In almost every day and night you can see it at work while hardening steel or forging swords. Someone thinks that the blacksmith pretends to be an old man. Others argue that it is under the influence of a powerful and ancient curse. The fact is that the Eternal Forge produces the best weapons and armour throughout the region and probably all of Aumyr, although the old owner does not want his creations to be sold to anyone.

### Meentum

![Kaphnur](/images/map-meentum-en.jpg)

The second capital of Inkari is accessible only from the surface, through a complex system of magically operated vertical ascension platforms. It is located in an immense natural cave and the whole area, from the shape of the houses, to the splendid fountains, to the multicolored ferns gardens, reminds us of the creed and doctrine of the Great Mother. The libraries house entire shelves filled with ancient and perfectly preserved volumes, the result of the patient work of hundreds of wizards and wise natives who preserve the precious lost fragments of Knowledge and Tradition.

#### History

- [453 AE](../chronology/#_453-ae) Tradition tells of how a powerful Native Shaman, known as "the First Matriarch", sets in this large cave the first stone of what would later become a great underground city dedicated to the Great Mother.

- [101 AE](../chronology/#_101-ae) Legend has it that the First Matriarch, although very old, dies in mysterious circumstances. It is written of how his spirit abandoned the mortal body to wander over other Planes of existence. It is the same year in which the Tribunal was built, which still stands today where it is thought that the First Matriarch has spent the last years of his mortal life.

- [81 CE](../chronology/#_81-ce) The city's existence is discovered by a group of external adventurers exploring the island of Inkari. The population is slowly beginning to contaminate itself with other races, even if for over a millennium the city will tend to denigrate the unions between natives and "exteriors".

- [342 CE](../chronology/#_342-ce) The culture and tradition of Meentum also opens up most of its secrets to external races, after a series of civil unrest aimed at promoting integration policies, as well as a civil war that contributes to changing public opinion.

### Districts

#### The Platforms

The only way to access Meentum from the surface is to use some flying platforms that serve as a control zone for a constant bustle of citizens and visitors. The platforms are no more than large slabs of polished stone that gently levitate towards the surface. It is said that the slabs contain powerful spells that determine the true nature and intentions of anyone who climbs or stands nearby.

#### Knowledge Alleys

It is the place where the Scrolls of Tradition are conserved, an entire district made up of stairs, libraries, alcoves, bookshops and small houses. It is home to a school of magic specialized in divination and many people go to this area in case they have lost something and need advice to find it, be it a person, an object or something else.

#### Umbral

The land and houses in this neighborhood are invaded by a climbing mushroom that constitutes an immense living organism called Umbral. Its existence is much older than the city itself and some people think that its origins are lost in legend. For millennia, its mushrooms and fruits have been used to create potions, heal diseases and enhance arcane rituals. There are those who say that the fungus reacts to magical or emotional stimuli.

### Points of interest

#### The Tribunal

In the middle of the cave, a building known as "The Tribunal" is located on a large raised area. It hosts Meentum government events, such as public sentences, proclamations of new laws, hearings of the Matriarchy, celebration of family unions, collective worship of the goddess, and more. Here the Matriarchs are named and a large stone inside the structure symbolizes the eternal tomb of the First Matriarch. It is said that touching the stone brings luck.

#### Sensorium

It is difficult to notice the interior of this cave, located on the darkest edges of the city. Inside, mirror floors, multicoloured walls and other quirks lead to rooms with a wide variety of properties, created to stimulate the senses and perception. The population claims that it is a hybrid between a monastery and a place of entertainment. It is possible to stop in the rooms and experience particular experiences, similar to astral journeys. Many people suspect that the building hides several secrets.

#### Sanctuary of the Great Mother

The centre of worship of the Great Mother, a large vaulted ceiling temple and large circular halls, is also the main seat of clerics, priests and paladins of the goddess. A maze of candles and arcane flames illuminate frescoed rooms, internal fountains and other plays of light that are reflected in the surrounding neighborhoods, symbolizing the omnipresence of the Great Mother. The lower rooms of the Temple house the Matriarchal and High Priestesses' accommodations.

#### The Broken Blade

Former academy for warriors and fighters, it was abandoned some time ago, after some expansion works brought to light the entrances of an Askari tomb. The Dorne Society and the Council have tried several times to explore it, but the Matriarchs have always denied every request for an inspection. The structure is closed to the public and magically sealed by 1744 CE. Voices say that it is the place of eternal rest of a creature with immense powers.

#### The Whitelight

The inn is the last refuge before venturing into the dark tunnels, and its name derives from the white stone tower above it. It has the same function as a lighthouse in the dark and accommodates both adventurers and visitors alike. In its main hall, there are also expeditions in the underground. The owner, a slender native and mellifluous, takes into account adventurers who no longer return to the inn, adding notches to a wooden wall behind the counter. Needless to say, the wall is covered with signs.

## Cities

### Geldast

The name is actually the abbreviation of "Geldastwrhar" which basically means "Gate City", referring to the Portal which is located a few kilometers north-east. An outpost punctuated by a series of tall houses and large warehouses, shipyards and taverns, it is enjoying a new wave of commercial expansion driven above all by the presence of new adventurers attracted by the mysterious lands of Inkari. In the city it is possible to find practically any kind of goods or services, as long as you have enough money. The richest of the richest people travel along the city streets, flanked by an armed escort, especially Swords Crusades, to avoid being attacked by thieves, criminals or vagrants.

### Hang-Dar

At one time a highly populated city, it has experienced a slow decline mainly due to the progressive incursions by pirates from Dragon Bay to Gwaldur. People, tired of the poor protection offered by the Matriarchate, preferred to retreat inland to the north to found new villages or communities. The issue is currently the subject of a major diplomatic node between the Council and the Matriarchy (which controls the southern part of the island). Walking through the city, without fortifications, you can admire the hundreds of houses built with sand solidified with clay cooked by the sun, the myriad of alleys and narrow streets that cross the Market Square, or the large terraces of noble houses that overlook the coast.

### Heldar

Located just a few kilometres south of Geldast, the city is famous for being home to a group of natives called "The Eternal Wheel". Formed by experienced adventurers of every class (but above all clerics) dedicated to Tradition, this organization is responsible for protecting and guarding the secrets of Tradition as commanded by the Grand Council. Many people think that it has been formed to contain and control the numerous ancestral threats present on the island even before the retreat of the Native people from the continent.

### Jundarai

One of the first places where, in 75 CE, the inhabitants of the continent established contact with the native race. It is now a large port transit centre for both travellers and goods from all regions. It is one of the few outposts on Inkari where natives are often mistaken for humans. A must for those who visit the city coming from the continent are the Sale Scure, a rough stone building that houses a collection of parchments narrating the history of the discovery of the island, its ancient mysteries and the troubled history of its inhabitants.

### Nimirdaz

In 188 EC, the city was the scene of one of the most significant events in modern history. Mardok, a frightening semi-divinity from another Plane, almost completely destroyed the city and sowed devastation throughout the southern part of the island. An army formed by inhabitants of the continent, adventurers, Natives and other creatures, faced the ancestral threat, and the soul of the creature was trapped in a Cube of the Aeons, a powerful artifact possessed by some members of the Eternal Wheel. The city has been reconstructed as a memory of union and brotherhood, and has been a pivotal point of the exchange of cultures between the Natives and other races.

### Radaris

Costruita utilizzando principalmente corde e legno provenienti dal vicino Bosco della Prova, la città è formata da una serie di camminamenti tra gli alberi, ascensori di corda, complessi sistemi idrici che distribuiscono l’acqua tra le abitazioni sfidando la forza di gravità, e in generale principi di architettura vegetale tipici di villaggi forestali. E’ una delle mete preferite dai ranger che vogliono migliorare le proprie capacità sfruttando le conoscenze millenarie dei Nativi sulla caccia, sulla flora e sulla fauna.

## Forests

### Wood of Trials

An area that has been used for centuries for training young fighters in Khoralis, the area is famous for being a dense cluster of vegetation with treacherous terrain and deep undergrowth. Originally it was used as a testing ground for boys who wanted to join the Hunters. Anyone who could survive in the forest long enough to find their way home, was actually welcomed as an adult member by Khoralis society. The forest still bears the signs of these harsh rituals, and is full of traps, famelic creatures, treacherous paths and fortune shelters among the trees.

### Hunter Jungles

The north-east part of the island is characterized by the presence of a dense rainforest and impenetrable populated by creatures of all kinds. It is used as a city hunting ground. It is not advisable to stay alone in such a dangerous place, in the forest it is easier to be prey than hunters.

### Mardok Jungles

Even the elders of the Native world avoid talking about this cursed place, a tangle of bushes without paths, black like night and plagued by fogs, acid vapors, toxic clouds, insects and diseases. Entering without a guide means certain death unless there is extreme motivation. The area was baptized in this way after the defeat of the astral creature known as Mardok. Recently, some warriors of Khoralis report that they have seen in the horrible bush tall and slender creatures, without eyes, made of the matter of shadow itself.

## Swamps

### Moor Marshes

Even if the territory is less extensive than the Black Swamps, the error of underestimating the danger should not be made. The marsh is nothing more than a misleading name that indicates an area full of movable greenish sands, due to the presence of some creepers growing between its rocks. The sands are difficult to recognize because they resemble undergrowth or are formed from the same colours of solid rock.

### The Black Swamp

This place was originally a large piece of coastal, cultivated and very flourishing land. Now it is said to be the home of a marsh tribe dedicated to mysterious and ancestral practices involving spiritism, cannibalism and some perverse forms of death. The other populations tolerate these old cults as long as their influence does not extend beyond the marshes. Some young, fearless and curious hunter from time to time tries to reach the villages of mud and rotten wood built inwards, but rarely do they return.

## Plains

### Stonemouth

One of Inkari's most sacred sites, the Stone Mouth is a large clearing known for the presence of a large polished stone monolith, equipped with a central hole at human height. Although the Native people know very well the legends in which this big stone is the protagonist, they don't like to mention the complete history of this place to foreigners. However, it seems that the stone "speaks" to those who are worthy, through a special tribal ritual known to some elderly people of the surrounding villages.

## Keeps

### Ghar-Melon

Even if the name means "La Prima Casa", in the language of the continent, it is controversial that a fortress so ancient and not of native origin can be found in these areas. The population of the local villages lies far from this place that they consider "unclean" or "sick". Some recent excavations have brought to light a series of objects typically used in an alchemical laboratory, perfectly preserved in magic chests: the use of numerous divination spells on the area has also revealed part of an underground complex submerged by sand, collapsed rooms and a large source of unknown power hidden in the depths of the earth.

## Temples

### Halls of Memories

Entirely carved into the mountainside, this structure is one of the highest points of the artistic and cultural wisdom of the Askari. Grandius halls with vaults still partially frescoed and numerous engravings tell almost everything we know about this lost civilization. The area is placed under the highest architectural protection by a group of Sapienti experts from both the continent and Native. The Dorne Society excludes the presence of a dungeon or some ruins inside it in addition to the known rooms, and the nature of the place is still the subject of historical debates.
