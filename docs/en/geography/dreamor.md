# Dreamor

![Banner](/images/banner-dreamor.png)

Dreamor is the centre of the world in many respects, both subjective and objective. It is the most extensive region: from the fronds of Darkwoods in the north to the Hills of Silence in the south, Dreamor is also home to the largest metropolis of Aumyr, Fivestar and the headquarters of the Council. It is the most densely populated region of the whole continent, given its historical and religious importance.

## Government

Elite oligarchical magocracy. A powerful organization called The Council has both political and religious power and, through the Council, oversees all administrative activities in the region, including territorial control.

## War

Dreamor has a large army made up of Fivestar's garrisons trained by Sons of Hardon. The Council can count on the support of thousands of men if it is necessary to defend the capital or the region itself. Due to its central location, Fivestar can also have armies from nearby regions, taking advantage of its location near the Night Sea. The people of Dreamor have rarely been attacked by any region, because they know that their government independence depends on a tacit neutral agreement with the powerful Council group.

## Population

The people of Dreamor pursue the ideals of knowledge and wealth. They are generally tolerant of all forms of culture and integration, arguing that the exchange of information is a real form of trade, just like gold. Although a large part of the population lives in Fivestar or in neighboring settlements, the region is fairly well populated due to its central location in relation to the surrounding regions. Caravan and maritime traffic is very frequent and small villages are located almost everywhere near the main roads. From Dreamor come the best wise men, scholars and enchanters from all over Aumyr.

## Religion

Five Worship (Hardon, Melian, Normod, Vel-Shar, Savas), including the Great Father and Great Mother. Fivestar is the center of the Five Worship, given its key importance in the history of the world. Dreamor is one of the most tolerant regions: both in Fivestar and in the surrounding cities it is generally possible to find temples of almost all known religions, but their influence is nevertheless directly or indirectly monitored by the Council.

## Capitals

### Fivestar

![Fivestar](/images/map-fivestar-en.jpg)

Legend has it that the town of Fivestar now rises at the exact point where the Five arrived on Aumyr. Fivestar is the world's largest known city, with its large temples, ancient towers and ancient palaces, nestled in a lava rock promontory in the middle of the Night Sea.

#### Districts

##### District of the Gods

It is the first large district that is crossed by anyone who crosses the main road leading into the city. As a consequence of the EU Treaty, it is possible to use the services of numerous temples dedicated to many divinities, even of different realms and floors in this neighborhood.

##### Westwall

Simply called "the Wall" because of its position close to the south-west rocky wall, it is a purely residential neighborhood that houses the majority of the city's population. In its streets it is possible to find individuals from various professions and social backgrounds. For many people, the sight of the golden dome of the Ars Amandi and the Fivestar Palace alone is more than enough reason to decide to settle in this area.

##### Upper Hill

An elegant block comprising villas, gardens and private lakes. In these exclusive neighborhoods there are the homes of nobles, famous personalities and even rich adventurers who can afford to buy some luxurious property.

##### Trade District

The "sleepless neighborhood" is a large, ever-active market. For many people living in Fivestar, trade is the main source of employment. Given the vastness of the district, it is very easy to be picked up by skilled thieves always ready to cut off some bags too much in sight, especially at sunset.

#### Points of Interest

##### Grey Academy

It is the most important magic school in the world. Built on the ashes of the building that Normod himself opened a couple of centuries earlier, the facility is able to accommodate several hundred students each year. The courtyard in front of it is famous for being the scene of magic duels, but it is also used as an auditorium for public sentences or theatrical performances.

##### Ars Amandi

Once a famous college for courtesans and young ladies, the Ars Amandi is the oldest tavern of Fivestar. It is a large building with a circular plan, surmounted by a golden dome that reflects the moonlight. In this place you can find a lot of information and is one of the most popular places for adventurers. Some say that somewhere in the city, probably still close to the tavern, the old activities of Ars Amandi have never been interrupted.

##### Fivestar Palace

Headquarter of the Council, it is a grandiose building formed by many tall towers in the central part of the city. From it you can enjoy a general view of the metropolis and surrounding lands. Rooms are generally closed to the public and only a small part is accessible by the population. The entire complex is protected by numerous defensive spells, as well as an impenetrable wall. Inside the palace you can find much larger spaces than outside: many novices of the Council are forbidden from walking around without a guide. Among the areas forbidden to the public are the Council (where the mortal remains of the Fives are thought to have been preserved), the Internal Rooms (seat of the Council) and the Portal Stone (the legendary place near the crypts, where the Fives arrived on Aumyr.

##### Sunset Hill

The people of Aumar believe that through cremation the spirit reaches the peace of the gods in a more complete way, free from the burden of a mortal body. The Hill is the place where the bodies of the inhabitants of the capital are cremated. For these reasons, a garrison of the Red Brotherhood is permanently stationed in Casagrigia.

##### The White Hand

A complex consisting of five towers with a pentagonal base and hanging ten meters from the ground, is currently home to the town library, the largest known collection of tomes and parchments of the civilized continent. The structure is directly controlled by the Council through an order dedicated to the preservation and copying of arcane texts, called the Order of Archivists.

##### Night Tower

Seat of the town guard, this ancient tower serves as a base for the military in patrol service. Contrary to the name, the tower is also famous for having an unquenchable fire at the top of the tower that directs the merchant ships of the Night Sea.

##### The Necropolis

A large depression located in the southern part of the city, beyond the perimeter walls, is called The Necropolis, the city cemetery. The presence of numerous family tombs suggests an older underground structure, but due to the shape of the meteoric rock, the accesses to the underground are buried, sealed or impracticable. During the day it is not uncommon to meet inhabitants and tourists in this part of the city, but at night the whole area is closed to the public and monitored by a group of selected Red Brotherhood guards.

## Cities

### Greenriver

Initially founded in the middle of the forest by a group of peasants, it is now half in the plain due to the numerous deforestation activities carried out over the decades. A division of the Wolfguard directly governs the city with the support of the Council, both to avoid the complete felling of trees and to maintain peace within the city. Frequently Greenriver is a destination for those who want to train and learn the work of the ranger, or warrior. From time to time, it is possible to find in the local tavern a detachment of the Dorne Society, which offers the best positions among its ranks.

### Greywall

Situated on the forest boundary, this fortified city was erected by the Keepers of Knowledge as a place of teaching and knowledge for the populations of the southern territories of Dreamor. In the city you can visit the Court of Knowledge, unique in its kind: a complex of buildings and lodgings where you can consult both rare books and participate in courses on the creation of spells, new forms of magic and arcane experimentation. Although the city's population practice little magic, dealing mainly with providing services to the Court, there are many foreigners who every year go to this city to try to deepen their arcane knowledge.

### Kinderun

The structure of the city is jagged like the coast itself that houses it: numerous platforms set in the rock a few meters from the sea and connected by rope and wooden bridges make the landscape unique and singular. The fishermen drop their boats from the stores with ropes in the morning, then pick them up in the evening and store the fish. But it's the night that Kinderun is covered in its true nature: a magical and mysterious place, where local legends increase as the thirst of ale at the taverns. One of the many gossip stories of a secret tunnel that leads to an underground cave underneath the nearby volcanic mountains, a strange place where a talking sphere reveals the destiny of those who find it.

### Lonestar

Situated on the southern border of Dreamor, in the middle of a semi-paludose area close to a mountain, the city is known for years as a customs control point for caravans from Laendil, or nearby Gwaldur. It has no perimeter walls, even if it is still visible the large vertical stones covered with runes that once generated a magical perimeter barrier, which did not allow selected goods to cross the border. Now the city is governed by a group of selected soldiers headed by a warrior-wizard, but he is often out of town due to some "special" assignments assigned by the Council. Many people think it is a spy for the money of the Circle.

### Morun

For several years the city has been the scene of bloody struggles between the Council and a large guild of thieves settled in these areas. Placed under the control of three powerful merchant families, the port now seems to have stabilised in a sort of internal political equilibrium. Fishermen claim that the thieves' guild still has a headquarters accessible through a sewerage complex under the city, and that over time they have silently extended their influence to nearby towns.

### Qadris

The name of the city recalls the number "four" and in fact the outpost is located near a large caravan junction. The fifty or more stone and wood buildings transport traffic to the capital or the surrounding areas. The city guide is entrusted to the Temple of Melian and its acolytes, wrapped in their yellow garments, watch over the city, roam armed and maintain peace.

## Hills

### Silence Hills

Although they are a very large part of the region, little is known about the history of these hills. The unique absence of animal creatures and in general of flora or water sources makes it a rather inhospitable place and very few enter if not for important reasons. The Hills are infested with monsters or other creatures, probably from the Silent Tower.

## Dungeons

### Balur Caves

Fishermen who pass through the entrance of the cave often claim to see something gigantic moving over the waters inside the cave. Recently, an exploratory expedition has discovered the wreckage of an ancient smuggled galleon and the remains of a large cargo of precious goods. Since then, the cave has also been known as the "Pirates' Cave".

### The Lone Tower

Once the home of some powerful sorcerer, it is a large structure with unusual shapes that doesn't seem to remain in your place for a long time. It is so old that it is considered to be a permanent attraction of the region. The tower moves randomly and continuously between the hills, but never leaves. The Council has often tried to dissolve the powerful spells that surround it, without success. Today the place is frequented by many risk-loving adventurers who try to find the Tower, convinced that anything in the tallest rooms has an invaluable value.

## Forests

### Moneywoods

In addition to providing timber for the construction of fishermen's boats along the coast, the Woods are said to be infested with numerous species of werewolves and each deforested area is usually the prelude to an attack by these creatures on the surrounding villages. For many years, the population of villages near the Forest of Coin has learned to defend themselves from these beasts, building traps, forging silver weapons and other mortal devices.

### Darkwood

Known especially for hosting the wolf guard's headquarters in Deepwood, Darkwood contains an incredible variety of flora and fauna, and many scholars travel from the surrounding cities to study new animal species or plants.

## Keeps

### Amakur

The ancient fortress of Amakur has for years been the seat of an organization of the Council dedicated to patrolling the Night Sea in search of criminal activity and smuggling. The castle has been recently restored and at the moment its prisons are home to some of the worst criminals in the regions. The guard soldiers see the transfer to Amakur as a kind of punishment, given the rumors that recent excavations have unearthed some underground tunnels full of monsters.
