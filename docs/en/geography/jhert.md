# Jhert

![Banner](/images/banner-jhert.png)

Bordering the Erthell Plains to the north and the Dead Islands to the south, Jhert is formed by a largely uncultivated and wild territory. The inhabitants of the region tend to move frequently from one settlement to another in order to exploit resources or trade. The region is famous for the beauty of its coastline but also for the alarming presence of wild creatures.

## Government

The territory of Jhert is divided into hereditary feudal monarchies. The children inherit the throne, both male and female. Every two years on the occasion of the Sunset Festival, the rulers are convened in the capital to discuss political and government issues around a large banquet. The event is also very much felt by the population, which gathers in the city to trade with visitors, to see friends far away or to learn about the gossip of court.

## War

The army of the region consists of all the individual garrisons of the fiefdoms. Even if they serve in the city of origin and under their ruler, the soldiers know very well that in case of conflict they will be called upon to defend the region, side by side with the other armies deployed in the territory, or at least a substantial part of them. For these reasons, all the garrisons are in some way in direct contact with each other, to allow a rapid adjustment of the forces in case of a gathering.

## Population

A large part of the population lives on the coast, preferring the fresh breeze that rises from the sea to the brackish effluents of the Flamewood forest or the solitude of the plains. The journey through the mountains is difficult, so many people choose to settle in cities rather than small towns. Considering that some villages in the North Plains are raided by various groups of goblinoids and other creatures, the resulting summary effect is that of a society that is dodged and distant, that cares little about preserving its own regional identity, preferring to live day by day its life away from prying eyes.

## Religion

Traditionally, the region is devoted to Melian. Many of its temples are located in the mountains or near the Flamewoods. The Red Brotherhood headquarter in Shieldbane, a small village at the foot of the mountains, is also of great religious importance. The location was chosen because of its proximity to the Gherzul Ruins, the ancient underground catacombs dating back to the pre-colonization period.

## Capitals

### Silversone

![Silversone ](/images/map-silverstone.jpg)

This coastal city is home to the majority of the population escaped from the Dead Islands after the 110 CE disaster. It is surrounded by a network of monoliths called the Veiled Runes that protect the city from the attacks of the undead. The inhabitants fear that the city may still be the object of impious incursions. In this regard, a garrison of the Red Brotherhood has long since settled in the capital.

#### History

- [110 CE](../chronology/#_110-ce) Throughout this disastrous year, a large mass of refugees, desperate and afflicted, settled in an area that would then become the centre of the city following the disaster on the Dead Islands.

- [341 CE](../chronology/#_341-ce) In order to better protect the new settlement, the only point of light within the radius of several kilometers of desolation infested by the undead, a government formed by paladins and former adventurers.

- [902 CE](../chronology/#_902-ce) Some city heroes found a choice of fighters experienced in the clerical arts, who would later become the Red Brotherhood. In the same year the Veiled Runes were erected.

- [1234 CE](../chronology/#_1234-ce) The region is once again seeing a large invasion of undead from the subsoil. Gherzul is discovered. The city is growing in size, gaining popularity as a safe haven and place.

#### Districts

##### The Tight District

Cumulative clusters of low cost social housing and small businesses that look out over the street. Over the years, it has become a ghetto for organised crime, and is often the subject of large-scale raids to tired thieves' organisations and seven others.

##### Veiled Runes

Around the city you can admire a series of vertical stones, several meters high, covered with engraved runes and faded symbols. When activated, they produce a series of powerful force fields that envelop the city like a dome. They were created to protect the city from the assaults of the undead. Today they appear to be little more than ruins wrapped in a soft blue glow, but it is thought that they are only off, waiting to be activated again.

##### Port of Sunsets

Silverstone's harbor is often mentioned by bards and minstrels because of the beauty of its landscape. In this area you can find taverns, shops, banquets, open-air markets, venues of organizations and various services. Some sailors roam the streets telling incredible stories of journeys to unknown coasts beyond the Sunset Sea, but the population tends to be no coincidence to those who attend too many inns.

#### Points of Interest

##### The Tradehouse

It is an emporium where you can find objects of all kinds left as a lien or sold by some adventurer. The strangeness of some objects present in this place makes it a suitable place for those who want to buy something unusual, know the story of a magic weapon, get rid of a cursed object or clear a curse. Given the dangerous nature of this place's activity, you can find a constant influx of visitors and adventurers from all over Aumyr.

##### Melian's Refuge

Silverstone owes much to the joint efforts of adventurers and members of organizations who over the years have sacrificed their lives to protect the city from the invasions of the undead. In this sacred area, where Melian is believed to have lived for a certain period in her former mortal form, there is a temple dedicated to her. During the Feast of Sunset, all rulers from nearby villages or important guests are hosted in some underground rooms of the temple until the end of the festivities, which last three days.

##### The Nightchant

Built with a dark wood type belonging to a forest now destroyed, this large tavern boasts of having hosted many famous heroes and adventurers. Its rooms, at low cost, are as spacious and comfortable as a few taverns on the continent. Some rooms on the back house a detachment of the Red Brotherhood, which is installed in a stable plan in the city.

##### The Seaways

It is the name of a large complex of warehouses, shipyards and small houses located in the Port of the Sunsets. For the right price you can rent transport to reach other regions by sea, or even order the construction of a personal ship. In this structure there are about a hundred craftsmen, master blacksmiths, carpenters and builders. The port streets are patrolled by a town militia also made up of former sailors, from whom it is difficult to escape or hide.

##### Eiburn

This large manor, originally an important elite monastery, has seen a succession of different destinations. It was prison, temple, barracks, dungeons, magic shop and more. Today the building houses a magic school. Inside you can find several different floors divided into more or less large classrooms, a large underground cellar with various laboratories and a tower-observatory.

## Cities

### Molos

The inhabitants of Molos know that they live in an area sadly famous for the presence of undead, mainly due to the presence not far from the famous Ruin of Gherzul. However, they feel relatively safe, knowing that the Red Brotherhood has elected Shieldbane as the main operational base for its activities. Given the scarcity of fish in the archipelago, it is rare for Molos people to find themselves fishing on the coast. Its artisans prefer to devote themselves to working iron, coming from the nearby mountains, or to the mixture of the excellent Molos wine, for which the city is famous.

### Pindar

The city, originally founded by some wild halflings, is used as a caravan restaurant for those who come from the West or the Way of Five. The square is famous for its triangular shape and is home to some very famous commercial activities. The "Forgia Verde", a forge owned by Leyna Laskill, is able to forge particularly effective weapons and protections against the undead that infest the region. The "Flaming Ember", a tavern with high ceilings built around a large fireplace that is rumored to be formed of indestructible stones, owned by Soran Malthas, an old humane low and plaque. The third is the "Temple of Dreams", a unique place where you can rent comfortable beds in oak and silk.

## Keeps

### Shieldbane

The fortified village of Shieldbane is located in a foothill position, on the merchant route to the city of Molos. It was the first civilized outpost to be invaded by the disaster of the Islands of the Dead in 110 CE. It was in those years that some heroes formed the first group of the Red Brotherhood here. Their headquarters still stands today in a mighty castle. The rest of the population of Shieldbane live around the headquarters, supplying the organization, from which they obtain protection from any threat beyond the high walls. Anyone is welcome in Shieldbane, even if the population condemns some arcane and divine practices fearing that they may once again upset the balance between life and death.

## Dungeon

### Sunset Halls

At the edge of a lake in the centre of the Planes, a quarry opens, connected to an old fortress. Near the quarry there is an abandoned outpost surrounded by a palisade built by some adventurers willing to explore the fortress. Whoever has explored these rooms tells of frightening armored horrors, of a huge central chamber that is sometimes full of corpses hanging from the ceiling with chains and that other times is empty, and of many ghostly sentinels that infest the entire area.

## Forests

### Flamewoods

Halflings, druids and rangers are among those who can move more easily between the mists of this evergreen forest. Others have the unpleasant feeling of being intruders, especially wild creatures who from time to time tangle their paths coming from the North. The northern part of this forest is formed by a marshy territory rich in saltwater pools, geysers and acid vapors. The heart of the forest can be reached by a small path from the city of Pindar to the interior, and only a few elderly druids know the right way to avoid being attacked by forest creatures.

## Plains

### Erthell Plains

This expanse of yellowish herbs and rocks is located north of the region and continues to occupy the southern part of Laangor. Along the fields you can glimpse free running horses or villages invaded by wild creatures. It is thought that the moorland is scattered with ruins dating back to the time of the first colonization two hundred years before, and that under its rocks there are many dungeons entering. Both adventurers and explorers have spent a lot of time mapping this territory, but the plain hides its secrets well.

## Islands

In 110 CE, the area was the scene of a bloody and unstoppable invasion by an army of undead from the subsoil. The causes of this event were never entirely clear, but many believe that a great power may have unleashed some powerful creatures that from Gherzul have carved an underground path in search of prey to the surface. Following this, the islands were almost completely abandoned and the survivors of the disaster took refuge in the hinterland, obtaining asylum from nearby cities.

### Deadmor

A former mining outpost in Jhert, from which rare metals made of natural alloys were extracted, after 110 CE it is a desolate place inhabited by some wandering undeads. Entire villages in ruins, burnt or infested with monsters and undead populating the landscape. In the eastern part of the island is still visible a large crater (then magically sealed by the Red Brotherhood) from which the invasion began. It is said that many necromancers live on this island, drawing their arcane energy from some negative currents in the subsoil.

### Etheris

The island is ignored by the fishermen of the nearby town of Molos, given the absence of fish nearby. Thanks also to its fame as a cursed and solitary island, it is often used by the pirates of the area as a warehouse of smuggled goods or treasures stolen from other merchant ships of the coast. It seems that a mysterious Captain called Morris Moran has brought together many criminals under one banner and is building a protected naval outpost in the southern part of the island, transforming it into an operational base for the illicit traffic of all the pirates of the nearby coasts.
