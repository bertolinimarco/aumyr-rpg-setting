# Laendil

![Banner](./images/banner-laendil.png)

Laendil is famous for its shady coasts, the presence of large forests and the beauty of coastal towns. It is a region largely occupied by the Nayalis Forest, which is also the western border of the territory.

## Government

Feudal oligarchy. The Council has understood for a long time that it is impossible to govern forest populations under a single flag. The group of nobles (mostly elves) who meet in Nayalis twice a year, is forced to supervise a series of principalities and small fiefdoms scattered throughout the region. Through this system, it is rare for the Council to intervene directly in political matters, even though it is constantly vigilant to prevent dictatorships or popular uprisings.

## War

The region does not have an army for many reasons, both political and territorial. In 2344 EC, a vote was called for among the fiefdoms: the majority preferred not to set up permanent armed forces and to rely on the protection of the forest itself in the event of an attack. It seems that it has survived its millennia thanks to the influence of powerful creatures who not only inhabit it, but also defend it. It is thought to be no coincidence that almost no trace of the Askari was found in the forest.

## Population

The inhabitants of small settlements live like the rural people of other regions, even though they take great care to take only what they need from the land. They live by hunting small game, cultivating tracts of land, or harvesting the nutritious Red Berries of the Forest, a sort of juicy fruit that is also a very nutritious food on par with a full meal. A large part of the population of Laendil possesses an innate forest affinity or knowledge of wild lands, and is hiding in the forest or caves at the foot of the mountains to be protected from rangers or druids, in case of attack or territorial threat. Some villages engage mercenaries or adventurers to defend themselves from the attacks of marauders, coastal pirates or wild beasts.

## Religion

Laendil worship the Fives and Native Gods, like the other regions. Due to the presence of the extensive Nayalis Forest, you can find numerous temples dedicated to Savas or other natural semi-fidelity. Many people think that Savas is actually a different representation of the Great Father and the Great Mother, a sort of herald of them in the modern world.

## Capitals

### Nayalis

![Nayalis](./images/map-nayalis-en.jpg)

Although many elves claim that Laendil's capital was supposed to rise in Mistdeep, the city of Nayalis has always been considered the "Forest Center". The area is a large collection of uphill and downhill roads, small altars, ponds, ponds, lakes, illuminated by golden green bulbs. The population is protected by an armed militia made up mainly of rangers, druids and warriors. Savas is recalled everywhere and almost everyone possesses at least one statue of the divinity in the home. The city centre itself is marked by a large fountain where bridges and climbing bridges are combined with androgynous sculptures of sublime beauty: all in an elegant and never exaggerated combination of nature and life.

#### History

- [8 CE](../chronology/#_8-ce) The first elves who arrived on Aumyr through planar journeys felt great racchusi powers in the forest and were fascinated by it, choosing it as a suitable place for a permanent settlement.

- [191 CE](../chronology/#_191-ce) Foundation the city. In the same year, a powerful and ancient artifact known as The Seed of the World was found. It will be kept for almost a thousand years in a secret and inaccessible place.

- [1202 CE](../chronology/#_1202-ce) A cabal of obscure enchanters faithful to an extraplanar divinity, destroys the Seed of the World and corrupts the city for more than three hundred years, transforming it into an immense open-air dungeon full of undead and other aberrations.

- [1512 CE](../chronology/#_1512-ce) On a day known as "The Awakening", the city is cleared of evil by a group of powerful magicians and druids elves. The Seed of the World, once restored to its original state, is handed over to the Council. The city will then be rebuilt by a group of druids and rangers, who will build most of the buildings still visible today.

### Districts

#### Moon Gardens

Called so because of the wonderful light effects that the moon produces on its land, it is the district that houses the popular and religious district. Many people decide to buy house in this area and a legend claims that Savas himself walks invisible in his streets.

#### Whitehills

The large hillside town is also home to the government, as well as to noble dwellings. The area is often frequented by historians, wizards and priests of different divinities, who often meet to discuss theological issues without too many resentments. It is thought that the terrain of Whitehill exudes an aura of tranquility that protects the area from negativity and violence.

#### Enclaves of the Awakened

It is a large, fenced-in and independent neighborhood, home to clerics, druids and religious fanatics. The population, known as The Awakened, obeys its own laws and in fact declares itself an independent community from any other government. They are mostly harmless pacifists, but they can become a serious problem if they are provoked. It is said that once out of the community it is no longer possible to re-enter it and that the entrance between the ranks of the Awakened is subject to a complex and articulated social selection process.

### Points of interest

#### The Dual Source

The city centre of the capital is recognizable for the presence of a complex fountain-monument, modified several times, which recalls the duality of the bene-male, grey shades, contemplative neutrality, the complexity of life and in some way the doctrine of the cult of Savas. The surrounding square is under the influence of a spell of perennial blessing, and the healing spells are enhanced by raising the maximum effect.

#### Temple of the Gifts

This strange and small temple is always full of objects and votive offerings. If the area is examined, you can perceive an intense magical energy pervading the whole place. At the center of the temple there is a very ruined and practically unrecognizable statue, probably of a deity. For some strange reason it is possible to enter and deposit objects, gold and offers, but it is not possible to take everything out of the temple, not even by magic means. Every now and then the offerings disappear and the statue changes position, but you don't know who or what to accept the offerings.

#### Dael-Madras

It is the name under which a large, secular, hollow and falling canopy tree is known. It is used as a secondary seat of the Company of the Wolf, as well as a training site for rangers, druids or simply for those who want to learn to survive coexisting with the forest. Sometimes the roots of the tree have moved, which suggests that Dael-Madras is actually a big sentient being endowed with his own consciousness.

#### Ruins of Melâ€™Shir

The population avoids these strange ruins, formed by piles of stones almost welded together, inverted arches covered with lichens and other bizarre architecture. During the years when Nayalis was known as a dungeon, it concentrated much of the insanity and wickedness of the creatures who lived there. Although the area has been repeatedly blessed by hundreds of clerics and adventurers and there is no trace of what was before, some superstitious people think that deep down there is still something dark and unbelievable.

#### Black Unicorn Tavern

Jherteg, the owner of this small but comfortable tavern, is a middle-aged halfling who loves to tell of his adventures, when he followed the travels and adventures of a famous group of heroes of the continent at an early age. Those who know him think that the stories he tells are just a ploy to attract adventurers to the inn, but no one can deny that he is a great bard and entertainer.

## Cities

### Jesper

Those who approach Laendil from the Night sea, can understand that they are arriving on the border of the region by observing the great lighthouse of the city of Jesper. The structure has recently been erected by some Master Builders to guard the surrounding coastline, infested by pirates. The inhabitants of the city are frank people with a loose language, not surprisingly they are also famous for becoming skilled thieves or shrewd politicians.

### Mistdeep

Protected by many druids and rangers, the city is famous for its hospitality and its tranquility, a true place of rest and meditation. Oak wooden houses connected by sturdy bridges of planks and ropes make the architecture respectful of the natural shapes of the ground. If it were not for the magic lanterns that at night make it a spectacle of lights and colors, the whole area would be confused with the surrounding trees. The centre of the city's activity is the "Ancient Heart", an old hollow tree adorned with runes, which houses a temple dedicated to Savas.

### Tamalen

The city is set in a small depression formed by a large slit in the ground. It is located on different levels connected by a maze of stone staircases, and on the bottom of the rock face there is a river that is exploited by the inhabitants as a water resource. The interior of some houses is characterized by the presence of frescoed walls dating back at least two centuries before. Little is known about the dwarves who previously lived in the city, but some elderly people report that the first explorers found the ruins abandoned as if the inhabitants had fled the city in a hurry.

## Forests

### Nayalis Forest

The druids claim that the Nayalis Forest is a place protected by Savas. If it were true, we would explain how the forest could survive the axes of the cutters practically intact. The area is too large for any group to dominate. At the moment, the guardians of this large green space are elves, centaurs, treants, fairies and other creatures including natural spirits. Travelers are often warned by the clerics of Savas or the druid groups walking along the paths: the dangers that the unexplored depths of this wooded territory can hide are ancient hidden ruins, monsters and numerous creatures ready to unleash their millennial fury on those who try to upset the natural balance.

## Mountains

### Atros Peak

Although it is a single mountain, Atros is undoubtedly the highest peak of Aumyr. Its inaccessible peaks are the dream of every climber and explorer, but so far nobody has managed to reach the summit of this giant. It is said that smooth and vertical walls, landslides, sudden snowstorms and creatures able to move on the walls make climbing impossible even for experienced adventurers. These stories have fueled the conviction that there are hidden treasures on the top of the mountain beyond imagination.

## Keeps

### Orianur Keep

Also known as "The Keep Without Walls", this unusual structure is formed by a large square tower completely without fortifications. The interior is made up of a dungeon consisting of salt infested with spirits and other creatures. Virtually no one lives near this place, making the dark legends about its construction even more mysterious.

### Blackguard

Historical structure, erected by the first founding members of the Wolfguard, this fortress stands on the forest boundary and for two centuries has been an impregnable outpost. Although today we can only glimpse a heap of ruins invaded by climbers, the population is concerned that it is now the meeting place for a powerful group of renegade rangers and druids. If it were true, the presence of this dark coven is a great threat to the whole region.
