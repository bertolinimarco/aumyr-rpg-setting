# Geography

The known world includes the continent of Aumyr, part of the icy and unexplored north and several nearby islands. Since 26 CE, the Council has been committed to dividing the world of Aumyr into Regions, or areas, suitable for the commercial and strategic and political control.

Aumyr has a long story before the Common Era, although most people don't want to waste too much time thinking of remote events, preferring to focus on the present. The wise explorer knows how to appreciate the history of the ruins that lie beneath him and the sky above him, because in them the secrets of the time are hidden.

## World Borders

### North

To the north there is the Icy Sea and further on extends an unexplored territory known as Eternal Glaciers. No civilization has been reported in these lands, apart from a few sporadic fishing villages, expeditions by explorers or members of the Dorne Society. They tell of how the icy territory is actually another small continent, with its own story, yet to be discovered.

### South

In the South, some sailors claim to have landed on a series of islands of different nature and shapes, but the stories are too unconnected and sometimes made up in the moment. The most seasoned sailors mention terrible spirits and creatures, great dragons or entire populations with multicolored tattooed skin and other incredible tales.

### East

To the east there is only the Sea of Sunset, an endless expanse of crystal clear and calm water. So they report those who have returned to Aumyr after years of sea navigation, without ever meeting the land. The few who have survived have returned with strange obsessions probably due to their long solitary stay in the sea. The last expedition to the southern borders of the world took place in 2088 CE. A fleet of a hundred ships departed from Silverstone with the blessing of the Gods and with supplies for many years of sailing. No one has returned.

### West

Several testimonies confirm how a night in 1989 CE, a strange ship with folded and unmanned sails appeared on the horizon of the city of Eathos, in the Gwaldur region. It remained in territorial waters for a short period and then disappeared without trace. The presence of a new world is surely appealing to many, but since nobody has managed to land in these supposedly new lands even from the East, new coasts and their position still remain a unsolved mystery.

### Seas

Aumyr has 4 main seas, all of which are part of a single mass of water known as the Infinite Ocean.
However, only a few individuals use this name, as almost no one venture beyond the horizon of the continent. Frontier territories are treated with immense respect and fear, at least by the most wise.

#### Mare del Tramonto

Il Mare del Tramonto, è una vasta distesa infinita di acqua cristallina, che segna il confine est di Aumyr. O così riferiscono coloro che sono tornati su Aumyr dopo anni di viaggi per mare, senza mai incontrare un approdo. I pochi che sono sopravvissuti sono tornati con strane manie dovute probabilmente alla loro lunga permanenza solitaria nel mare. L’ultima spedizione verso i confini meridionali del mondo è avvenuta nel 2088 CE. Uno stormo di cento navi partì da Silverstone con la benedizione degli dei e con provviste per molti anni di navigazione. Ad oggi nessuno ha fatto ritorno.

#### Frozen Sea

The northern boundary of Aumyr is marked by the Frozen Sea and beyond it lies an unexplored territory known as the Perennial Glaciers. No civilization of any kind has been reported in these parts, apart from a few sporadic fishing villages, expeditions of explorers or members of the Dorne Society. They tell how the frozen territory is actually another small continent with a story yet to be discovered.

### Eternal Ices

Almost no one adventure on the frozen shores beyond the Sea of Eternal Ice. Endless frozen lands constantly crossed by ice storms make it impossible to create advanced civilization. Recently founded, a village founded by the Dorne Society as a base camp for future exploration called Norn, serves as a refuge between these unexplored lands and the continent. In this outpost you can find a hot meal in the tavern or stock up with supplies to reach Angor, a ruined fortress trapped in snow and ice and the only point marked on the maps. The Council thinks that frosty lands contain many secrets and that the small piece of land explored north of Aumyr is actually an entire continent detached from the hinterland after the Cataclysm.

### The Underground

Over the centuries, many upheavals have affected the creatures and races, flora and fauna that populate the surface of the continent of Aumyr. The sages question the possibility that the earth can preserve, even deeper than the mines and the oldest Ruins, a vast and dark unknown world called Underground. In this almost parallel world, it is said that unknown races and legendary creatures, made of shadow and darkness, protect unspeakable secrets. Anyone who could explore this "world under the world" would certainly witness unbelievable discoveries and great powers.

### Exus

In an undisclosed location, far beyond the west borders of Faeland and beyond the Sea of Souls, lies the complex called Exus Islands. The whole area is surrounded by a magic force field consisting of a multitude of spells maintained by an amalgam of magic and technology of the Askari.

Exus acts as a prison and containment structure for the most dangerous sentient beings on Aumyr (and someone also suppose other Planes). Almost all users of arcane arts, the "inhabitants" of Exus are kept in permanent stasis in cells that are de facto accesses to demi-planes scattered in the infinite Void. In layman terms, the entire complex functions as a huge archive. The upper prison structure, the only visible point in the distance, is formed by a tower of basalt and black obsidian that stands out on the smallest island, surrounded by what seems to be a perennial fog. Actually, it is a series of self-propelled dead magic zones that make divination spells, teleportation spells and other forms of displacement completely impossible both inside the complex and on the island itself.

The other island, slightly larger and only a few kilometers away, has no special characteristics. There is no flora or fauna and probably it is the upper part of some even larger submerged complex.

No one knows the exact appearance or nature of these structures. Escaping from Exus is considered impossible.

#### The Guardians

The management of the entire complex is under the responsibility of an organization simply called "The Guardians". No one chooses to become a Guardian. Thanks to a millennial agreement with the Council and the approval of all civilized regions, some of the newborn babies abandoned in temples or cities are chosen to be initiated as Guardians and begin their lives on the island.

## Observatories

Ancient archaeological wonders, the Observatories are one of the greatest mysteries for Askari researchers. They consist of large, semi-circular chambers with also semi-circular ceilings, covered with arcane glyphs, included in huge lounges filled with large astronomical observation machines. Someone claims that the Askarians arrived "from the stars" and that during their stay on Aumyr they desperately looked for a way to return to the stars.

Observatories allow a creature with above-average Intelligence to observe a precise point in the celestial vault or another Plane of existence. The knowledge required to use the Observatories is called Contemplation. Usually it is a three-dimensional image generated at the centre of the hall, but visible only to the person who requested it, and to the Custodes of the Observatory. It is said that no place can be hidden from an Observatory. A fee is paid for their use by the Council, which guarantees their management and use for those who request it (however, the Custodes of an Observatory reserve full powers regarding every aspect of the management of these structures).

Until now, three Observatories are known:

- Nembus Observatory
- Gaulur Observatory
- Akar Observatory

## Portali

Portals are large circular structures, about 6 meters high and 6 meters wide. They allow you to move quickly from one place to another. They form a perfect circle and set in an indestructible stone base for about one sixth of their height. They are made of a material similar to metal but do not seem to suffer any kind of damage. They resist centuries, elements, magic and even the most powerful rituals. They are thought to have been the main channels of communication for the distribution of the planet's resources by the Askari. Today they are all still working and allow the instantaneous transport of goods and people from one part of the world to another.

### Using the Portals

All the portals are bidirectional and persistent, they all connect with each other and are always working. There is no minimum or maximum number of people they can carry. To set a destination, the traveler only needs to use the mental will. Creatures with little or no Intelligence cannot cross the Portal, except for a few rare exceptions (families, sentient constructs, animal comrades, etc.). The Council also uses the Portals to transport non sentient creatures or against their will (for example, to transport prisoners from one place to another, through the use of magical tools). No one knows the exact technological or magical nature of the Portals, their indestructibility makes them autonomous and in need of very little attention.

### Management and control

The Portals are closely watched by a garrison of soldiers in the pay of the Council, to prevent smuggling of goods or illegal flora and fauna to other regions. These frontier soldiers are very experienced in dealing with criminals, treating them daily with hundreds of travelers who travel to Aumyr. It is not uncommon to find urban settlements or many villages around a Portal, due to their commercial nature. The passage from one Portal to the other is subject to a tax to the Council.

### Fivestar Portal

Also called "the Center" is located on a small hill near Fivestar. The Portal is the main hub for business within the capital and surrounding regions, and is crossed every day by thousands of people who travel to other cities or other parts of the continent, who for work, who for adventure.

### Damodar Portal

Simply called "the West", the Portal is just a day's walk from Damodar, in Laentas. A very popular route for those coming from the Centre, it is one of the most used portals for the trade of large loads and caravans.

### Geldast Portal

If you cross a Portal to Geldast, you go "to the Island", and rarely travel alone. It is often a destination for adventurers and mysterious seekers, as the jungles and landscapes of Inkari Island are still largely unexplored.

### Highpine Portal

"Goin' to the North" is a fairly common expression for travelers crossing a Portal to Highpine, in Laangor. For those coming from the South, it is advisable to pay attention to the sudden change in temperature and climate due to the northern position of the region.

### Westorn Portal

If the destination of your trip with the Portal is Westorn, you go to "South" or to the "Hot Lands". The Portal is not close to any of the main cities but is an important hub for trade routes, allowing travelers to quickly reach many different territories such as the adjacent Portal Bay, the Thanaros desert to the south, the Faeland plains to the north, the Nayalis Forest to the east.

## Ancient Ruins

### Gherzul

Also known as "The Ancient Necropolis" is a large underground city formed by hundreds of catacombs connected by small tunnels and large tunnels. Probably in ancient times it was a giant ossuary or a very important cemetery. The number of bones suggests that the subsoil environment or particular rock conformation has acted as a preservative, allowing thousands of bodies to preserve themselves more or less perfectly. Gherzul's control is entrusted to the adventurers of the Red Brotherhood, originally born with the aim of keeping the enormous structure under control and also financed by the Council. The catacombs do not seem to have an end and its wells of bones, underground towers, long and gloomy caverns, unhealthy air and other dangers, are considered one of the most dangerous places throughout the continent.

#### The Temple of Life

The first structure that can be reached through the entrance of Gherzul. It was once an extensive complex of rooms and priest's lodgings, which were used for funeral services. At the centre of the dungeon there is a large hall with a central well (with a spiral staircase at the side) that allows you to reach the catacombs below. In the temple it is possible to find a garrison of the Red Brotherhood that uses it as a base camp for the explorations below.

#### Catacombs of Resurrection

It is said that the horde of undead broke out from here, invading the continent in 110 CE. It is a maze of caverns dug into the tuff and hard stone: alcoves, burials and unnamed tombs everywhere. The area is pervaded by strong negative energies. They are thought to be generated by centuries of neglect and decay, others believe that it is because of the particular composition of the soil of this subsoil area. Many sorcerers and wizards buried here to rise up as undead or lich. In this level there are also dozens of small temples and secret rooms accessible only to those with the key.

#### Conservation Chambers

A parallel dungeon to the Catacombs of Resurrection, here rest the bodies prepared for burial. The rooms are punctuated by strange machinery for the treatment of corpses, most of which are now in ruins. Traces of Askari materials, such as utensils, strange pipes and scrap metal furniture can be visible on tables or stone alcoves.

#### Tomb of Mok-Hothep

A complex of rooms that are difficult to reach, equipped with deadly traps guard the mortal remains of God-Emperor Mok-Hothep. Access to its underground chamber was only recently theorized, when polished stone chambers adorned with strange hieroglyphics were discovered during an exploration.

#### The Ossuary

Nobody knows how this level of the dungeon is reached. It is told of how a large cylindrical well contains an enormous collection of bones of various kinds, numerous chambers full of strange machines for bone processing and other mysteries. At the bottom of the cylindrical chamber, there seems to be a kind of "cap" that would allow you to descend to a place known as the Deep Night. The existence of this strange dungeon would be described in an ancient tome present in a forgotten tomb.

#### The Deep Night

The existence of this place has only been theorized by reconstructing some old maps dating back to the pre-colonial period. Probably the real secret of Gherzul is hidden in these unattainable depths. The papyrus only quote a few enigmatic words about what lies at the base of Gherzul:

> Unexplored, unknown territory. Unnamed beings, entities of darkness, shadows, devourers of the soul...

### Irem

Nobody can determine where it is with certainty. Adventurers tell of expeditions to the desert in search of this fabulous "City of Thousand Pillars", and the only testimony of such a place came through the writings of an adventurer made crazy by the deadly dangers of the desert. The writings speak of a city full of colors and life, fed by a thousand fountains which in turn are fed by sources of pure and almost divine underground water. Irem is made invisible by the sand storms that envelop it and the frequent mirages that it generates lead to madness and death even the most experienced adventurers.

#### The Lost Path

The city itself can only be reached by crossing a parallel dimension in which it is confined. Wandering through the desert you can come across some pillars buried in the sand. Activating one of the pillars allows you to reach the size and thus the city. It is full of creatures "out of phase", moved on different Planes, dimensional quirks like flying lands and more.

#### The Eternal Dream

Irem is a dream and this is the most suitable definition for describing its structure. The pillars of the Lost Path are nothing more than a "tuning fork" that allows you to "tune in" to the planar vibrations of the dimension in which the city is confined. In practice, Irem exists in the dimension of dreams and is accessible only by dreaming close to one of the activated pillars. The transition between dimensions is not noticed precisely because of the difficulty in distinguishing reality from dream. Irem's creatures are mainly mixed, Djinni, Dao and other elemental races. They don't realize that they have been confined to a parallel dimension, so every attempt to communicate with its inhabitants in this regard is in vain, as if they were magically convinced not to understand every argument in this sense. In the city you can find shops, merchants and other curiosities. It is possible to leave the city only by dreaming of Aumyr and clinging to a particularly powerful past memory that took place on the "real" continent. Many explorers don't have memories powerful enough to make the dimensional transition and get lost forever amidst the beauty of the lost city, trying to dream eternally and becoming part of the structure of the city itself.

### Kandros

Kandros is considered the Forge of the World. Situated inside the largest volcanic complex in Aumyr, it is a maze of lava and obsidian stone rooms, tempered by fire and magma. The city itself consists of many parts sinking into the lava, inaccessible broken corridors and other fiery landscapes. The whole complex is subjected to frequent collapses and changes dictated by the unstable behavior of the volcano, parts are reshuffled and reshuffled continuously, making it very difficult to map and explore the place completely. Each kind of creature has taken possession of the upper rooms of the dungeon, and only a couple of people in the world can still report what is in the depths of the volcano: an Ancient Forge, a huge place where you can create wonderful and legendary objects.

#### The Fire City

A large semi-device settlement built on various spurs of rock immersed in a gigantic cave dotted with magma lakes. From here the vapours are generated, which are then transformed into the thick mist of the foggy Mountains. It's a dungeon full of salamanders of fire, elemental, powerful spellcasters and seven elementals (who have their home here) and other dangerous creatures.

#### Black Chimneys

A series of endless precipices and ravines, interspersed with groups of rocks that magically stop and move between alkaline vapors from the depths. It is a den of many illusory creatures (shapeshifters, mimics, spirits, vampiric mists, etc.) that manipulate the vapors to incinerate or plunge into emptiness the unfortunate explorers. The path to continue to the lower levels of the ruin passes through these spurs of rock overhanging on deadly cliffs, constituting also the only road that can be travelled by land to reach the subsoil.

#### The Cave of Thousand Trails

A huge labyrinth of caves, caverns, tunnels, ravines and underground lakes immersed in total darkness. Aberration dwellings, nameless nightmares and tentacles grasping silent in the dark.

#### The Ancient Forge

In the deepest part of the mountain there is a huge semi-circular vaulted room containing a complex machine, probably of Askari origin. It is said that in this place it is possible to manipulate the essence of creation, the very fabric of reality, in order to create wonderful objects.

#### Uulumatsu

A complex of caves invaded by acid vapors that instantly dissolve any creature that puts its foot on it. It is said to be the home of an ancient black dragon and that this being has built its den using powerful artifacts.

### Lheng

The best way to describe Lheng is to imagine an inverted tower, or a circular crater, which opens into the ground, three hundred meters wide and at least five times deep. On the sides of this crater, a path set in the rock and punctuated by numerous caves dug on the side of the crater, allows explorers to reach the bottom, or at least so it is thought, considering that no one has survived to tell it. Some wizards, flying over the area with divination spells, swear to have seen numerous creatures move around and fly through the bottoms of the strange crater, before a power never seen before prevented the vision of anything hidden at the bottom.

#### The Inverse Tower

The large external opening. It is possible to descend through a dangerous lateral path, formed by thousands of slabs of various sizes embedded in the bare rock. During the descent, you can see numerous caverns that open into the wall of the gigantic well. The openings are nests of various very dangerous creatures, often flying like imp and other entities, who have fun in plunging the explorers into emptiness.

#### Koiansterruu

It is said that a group of monstrous winged beings similar to gargoyle dwell in a castle of lava rock formed by precipitous stalactites, at about half the height of the descending path. The area is surrounded by thousands of metal chains anchored to each side of the gigantic circular well. It is thought that these can be used by gargoyle to trap any unfortunate person falling from the side descending path. The exact nature of this place is still being investigated by the Dorne Society. Some explorers think it's a cursed place: Lheng is all too easy to lose his life, hindsight or something worse.

#### Tholkor's Lair

Given the danger of this ancient ruin, it has always been believed that in the bottom of Lheng lies a huge treasure, or an object with legendary powers. Nobody has so far been able to explore its most hidden depths, even if some wizards specialized in divination report that they have seen tentacles in the fog, strange appendices and numerous other suggestions of an unthinkable and alien creature.

### Lornat

A large fountain, now drained, is all that remains of the ancient city in the middle of the Merosh Mountains. Those who have ventured in search of this lost ruin report constructs capable of animating themselves with arcane and mechanical methods, large rooms dotted with unknown fountains and wildlife, columns inlaid with impossible motifs, wandering spirits and other oddities. All rumors seem to agree on the presence of one or more large rooms, a sort of underground temple, where it seems possible to find answers on one's future. The scarce evidence of the existence of all this makes Lornat the subject of suppositions and myth.

#### The Fountain

The only visible ruins of Lornat consist of a large fountain destroyed in the middle of a small one on the Merosh mountains. Today, the building is considered only a heap of ruins by most adventurers and every attempt to divinate in search of arcane springs is vain.

#### The Mysteries

The Fountain is actually a powerful dimensional device that allows you to reach a group of various sizes that make up the structure of Lornat, called "The Mysteries". These demi-planes take different forms depending on who accesses them, and the nature of the spaces varies according to the alignment and morale of the traveler. It is basically an infinite dungeon, created by the ancient Askari for mysterious purposes. The latest assumptions of the Dorne Society about this place are fragmented. Surely this is one of the biggest questions of Aumyr and more generally one of the most important unsolved ones about Askari culture and society. The only testimony about the existence of Lornat is contained in the fragmented personal notes of the famous explorer Arvath Lindale. Discovered in the mountains in 1566 CE, his diary is currently preserved by the Dorne Society.

> LThe discovery of the Lost City of Lornat is proceeding at a fast pace[...]. The secret to accessing it lies in the mountains. .... the peculiar form of the ridge in the western part[....]. We immediately felt as if we had descended into a tunnel. A slab of what it looks like [....] .... immediately surprised us. The interior chambers are beautifully worked, nothing suggests that the [....]... such a complex system. The creation of [....]. We lost [...] .... days without doing anything relevant, except [....].... I now write these notes without hoping that somebody will one day find them, because [...] .... think about what is inside each one of us. I hope that through [....]... the way for the outside.

### Olovar

This flying city-dungeon is actually a mass of giant rock that, exploiting the ancient power of huge crystals placed at the base, moves constantly pushed by the wind, in every corner of Aumyr. The city can only be reached by flying, as there are no known means of locating its position or reaching it by land. According to rumors, it seems that the city often fly over a volcano to take advantage of the warm upward currents generated by heat and magma. Some wise men claim that through volcanic heat, the crystals at the base can recharge their power and support the megalithic weight of the city. Even if we speak of "city" in reality Olovar is a gigantic dungeon in the open air, in all senses. Demoniac creatures or even older beings, hidden shadows and other curses await anyone who dares to desecrate this tomb in heaven.

#### The Skydragon

It is a stone complex in the center of the city, shaped like a giant dragon. Inside, there is a cult dedicated to worshiping these creatures, as well as dozens of them in various stages of seniority. The Dorne Society thinks that the structure itself can be a legendary petrified dragon and destroyed thousands of years ago.

#### Winding Docks

The ruin of Olovar can only be reached by flying, and the Port of Winds is the perfect place to dock your flying ship or other means that crosses the skies. It is a pity that it is now infested with hundreds of spirits and demons of the Elemental Vortex, which make any mooring maneuvers impossible, in a scenario of floating wrecks, ropes and suspended bridges, self-propelled pieces of land and other dangers.

#### The Shouting Caves

The interior of the inverted mountain that forms the base of the city is a maze of caves full of powerful crystals that with their powers help to keep in heaven all the ruin. Anyone who enters these caves without magical protection is overwhelmed by the deafening noise of the wind that enters through a thousand ravines. Spells are almost impossible to cast because the wind and noise, making it difficult to even breathe. It is thought that somewhere in these caves there is a portal for the Elemental Vortex.

### Perdol

It is said that very few have suffered as much as the inhabitants of the ancient city of Perdol. Some of the testimonies found on the surface show the remains of a splendid and very rich settlement, in which it was possible to find all sorts of material and spiritual wellbeing. Subsequently, during an epoch-making earthquake, the earth sank for several hundred metres into the darkness of the subsoil. Tens of thousands of people died in a dark and suffocating embrace as tons of land covered and modified the overhanging ground. The Scar of Perdol is a deep pit wide enough to be visible from the surrounding mountains. What remains of the city is fragmented at the bottom, formed by several levels connected by stone bridges almost disappeared. It is said to be the last dwelling place of some evil spirits and anyone who wants to explore the ancient city finds an end similar to those who lived there.

#### The Scar

The canyon on the surface is several hundred meters wide and splits the surrounding landscape like a wound. On the sides it is possible to glimpse fragile wooden and stone structures anchored to rock spurs. The bottom of the crater is a dense set of clouds, fogs, miasmas and echoes of nameless creatures.

#### The City of Bridges

Part of Perdol's city centre was made up of a series of dwellings connected by bridges, suggesting that the city was already standing in antiquity on a natural canyon, dotted with central rock bastions supporting a tangle of settlements anchored on their summits. In this area the soil is unstable and there is a constant risk of slipping or losing the way to the bottom of the crater.

#### The Deep Swamp

The bottom of the ruin seems to be an immense sulphurous swamp, whose eternal mists would prevent the sunlight from filtering through. It is home to even more dangerous spirits, mushrooms and other creatures, the result of the perverse evolution of the fauna and flora of this geological strangeness.

### Valimar

Valimar is the favourite topic for seafarers. There seems to be a gigantic underwater city off the coast between Laentas and Nordavind. The maritime stories narrate outposts of sea creatures for commercial exchanges with surface and continental races, submerged ships converted into dwellings, treasures and statues scattered on the bottom, a greenish light that permeates every building making the city visible at the bottom of the ocean. The stories contain a background of truth, since recent explorations have indeed shown that the city exists, but not many people have the means to reach the sea bed, and just as few who manage to deal with the strange and sentient creatures that populate this underwater kingdom.

#### The Island

A very small surface island, not indicated on the maps because of the difficulty in finding it. It is the upper part of the underwater city of Valimar and a way to get to the city without having any dive or water capacity. The island is inhabited by several clans of marine creatures, who establish an independently governed settlement.

#### Abyss Tower

It is a vertical underwater tunnel that leads to the city from the surface, almost one kilometre long. Similar to a large underwater tower, this place allows access to the city through internal self-propelled platforms. It is controlled and patrolled by hordes of sirens, marids, aquatic salamanders and other sea creatures.

#### The Underwater City

The heart of the city is made up of glass-like constructions and strange shapes, which contain both houses and commercial outposts. It is possible to gain the power to breathe underwater through a strange seaweed with magical powers, sold almost everywhere. Foreigners and adventurers are not welcome and every inhabitant of the place is suspiciously observing anyone who enters the city.

### Xartar

Former metropolis and probably the capital of Askari, Xartar is the largest known underground complex, formed by several connected dungeons that wind through the depths of the earth. The center of the complex is located in a gigantic cave and mostly preserved from time immemorial. Creatures of all kinds, monsters, wildlife in the subsoil, artificial light from the city's ruined buildings, coming from unknown sources make Xartar one of the greatest archaeological treasures of Aumyr. Numerous adventurers are perished among its large rooms populated with monsters and other creatures. Explorers' Outpost A subsoil settlement serves as a base camp for expeditions into the ruin of Xartar. It is presided over by an elite group of the Dorne Society, but its position often changes to prevent too many adventurers from attracting hordes of creatures to the surface.

#### Explorer's Outpost

An underground settlement serves as a base camp for expeditions into Xartar's ruin. It is chaired by an elite group of the Dorne Society, but its position often changes to prevent too many adventurers from attracting hordes of creatures to the surface.

#### Xartar Rings

The ruined city is built in an immense underground cave and formed by several rings or neighborhoods, each with different protections and arcane bans. Hordes of creatures of all kinds seem like regeneration, fed by the power of the obelisk, and attracted in some way from the city centre.

#### North Quarter

In the north the city is a maze of buried streets and collapsed houses. Large self-propelled roots wrap around every construction and the air is often made toxic due to numerous vapors and gases from some underground geysers. In this part of the dungeon you can come across drow, beholder, myconid, fungiform creatures and other aberrations.

#### South Quarter

The whole area is enveloped in a spectral blanket and a haze that makes it almost impossible to orient oneself. Many explorers are caught by something that wanders through this alien mist, nest of invisible and whispering creatures. The fog absorbs spells, for which it is not possible to cast any spell, neither arcane nor divine, unless there is a way to dissolve it temporarily.

#### East Quarter

The eastern part of the complex is the domain of a powerful creature known as Orgul. The explorers of the Dorne Society report that it may be a devil imprisoned in a mortal body and forced to pass eternity locked up and chained in the Well of the Ascension, a real sub-dungeon filled with demonic servants, external creatures and perhaps even a portal to hell.

#### West Quarter

A powerful enclave of mind-flayer took control of the west quarter of Xartar, establishing here a base camp presided over by an Ancient Mind attracted by the boundless psychic energy emanating from the Obelisk. These creatures tend to imprison and enslave every creature different from them, to use them as a work force or as perverse entertainment.

#### The Obelisk

At the centre of the dungeon is a huge sculpture simply called the Obelisk. The structure is deeply embedded in the ground, and measures almost a hundred meters high. Nobody knows the real nature of this odd construction, but the bluish energy that emanates seems to have many magical properties, so much so as to power powerful machinery and other structures surrounding the place. Many people think that it is even older than Askari race, and that once its surface is touched, you can receive immense powers and beyond imagination. The problem is, of course, to be able to reach the centre of Xartar, which is far above any mortal being.

### Zimara

Zimara is the forbidden dream of every treasure hunter. The first excavation point in the depths of the mountains, this Askari town has been carved from a series of mines and tunnels excavated with unknown techniques, corridors made perfectly smooth and round through ancient technology. The mineral veins have never been completely drained, and the whole complex is still an incredible site where you can find any mineral, provided you then find the way to the surface. It is said that in the circular tunnels there are various communities of criminal races formed by an amalgamation of sentient and non sentient creatures. In any case, Zimara minerals are among the most sought-after in the world.

#### The Zimara Mines

It is an outpost that constitutes the main entrance to the mines of ruin. Here you can find adventurers camps, carvers, master jewelers and other amenities. Many people resell in this place what they find in the winding underground tunnels.

#### Circular chambers

This is a complex of tunnels and circular rooms excavated with an unknown method. The walls are perfectly smooth and seem to be made of hard stone. Inside there are strange constructs and sentient creatures of the subsoil. The magic of the rooms is fuelled by crystals placed on the ceilings or on the floors of the room.

#### Ruins of the Shining City

The real heart of Zimara is an Askari city built in the center of a large underground cave. You can find rare and legendary minerals, as long as you can survive in an immense dungeon populated by horrific abominations, spores, constructs made of crystals and gems and other dangers. It is said that a creature with psychic powers has taken control of many creatures.
