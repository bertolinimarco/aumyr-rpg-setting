# Laentas

![Banner](/images/banner-laentas.png)

Laentas is the variegated region between the Golden Forest to the East, the Sunrise Islands to the West and the Gulf of Darkwaters to the South.
It includes a main peninsula and an archipelago of several secondary islands, no less important. The region is a varied territory, consisting of both coastal landscapes and mountain ridges, especially inland. Its coasts are often a refuge for adventurers and pirates, but also for eclectic, solitary and free thinkers.

## Government

The center of power is formed by an association of maritime merchant republics who join in a Grand Council once a year. The power is delegated to local Mayors who manage the towns and villages, taking care of maintaining order on the islands and in the seas, through the establishment of their own fleet or military force. In the past, this custom has allowed some powerful merchant principles to gain power through the control of numerous ships and commercial activities. Although the population is convinced that the Republics are the result of a meritocratic direct democracy, many people think that the government is, in reality, not under the direct control of the people.

## War

The backbone of the Laentas army consists of a joint naval fleet made up of all the armies of the Mayors and the armed forces of the Republic. In the event of war, the strategic location of the islands allows for the rapid construction or repair of ships, protected from land attacks. The many coastal ravines can serve as maritime artillery depots and various types of artillery stores. The sailors of Laentas are famous for their determination and skill: many of them serve as private guards in the Crossed Swords or even as guides in the case of maritime expeditions of the Dorne Society.

## Population

The inhabitants of the hinterland tend to group together in small villages and become settled, while the bulk of the population is scattered between islands or coastal towns and often travels between maritime routes in search of new opportunities. The population is as varied as the territory of the region, reflecting different characteristics depending on the country or city of origin.

## Religion

Melian (Air domain) and Savas (Water domain) make up the bulk of the population's creed, although the cult of all Gods is tolerated. In every town on the coast it is possible to find priests able to cure numerous diseases, while in the hinterland clerics are more specialized in the divine arts.

## Capitals

### Damodar

![Damodar](/images/map-damodar-en.jpg)

The Port on the Splendent Coast is a kaleidoscope of colors and structures typical of a large merchant outpost. From the Sea Court to the West Gate, Damodar has always been the background of many adventures and stories. Many people think that it is the second most populated city on the continent, just after Fivestar. The city is also the symbol of the naval power of the Consortium, an association that has helped to shape its current appearance.

#### History

- [91 CE](../chronology/#_91-ce) The first inhabitants found the city near a place then known as "The First Stone".

- [1013 CE](../chronology/#_1013-ce) The city expands to become the capital of the region under the reign of Argonos, the King-Hero.

- [1717 CE](../chronology/#_1717-ce) During the rainy night that will be remembered forever as "The Night of Terrors", the monarch is murdered and the city plunges into a dark period, ruled by a sect of assassins.

- [1722 CE](../chronology/#_1722-ce) A powerful group of outlaws and runners of the Night Sea joins under one flag and helps to bring the city back under the control of the population.

- [2081 CE](../chronology/#_2081-ce) The first Organization for Portual and Trade Control is born on the Commerce in the Night Sea, which will later take the name of Consortium.

### Districts

#### Bazaar

There is no goods that have not been exchanged between the stone ravines of these alleys. Once upon a time the Bazaar area was almost as large as the city itself; even if today it is a neighborhood, it is impossible to find an area that has not been engraved to manage inventories, calculate values of goods, and more. It is very easy to get lost, so much so that carved into the street there are indications for the various areas within the district.

#### Red Quarter

The area that houses temples, city archives and organizational structures. The name suggests the soft red nuance emanating from the nearby District of Lanterns. Many hanging gardens can be seen, and the streets are often covered with multicolored petals. It is a rich neighborhood, the favorite of many ambassadors, wealthy merchants and itinerant adventurers.

#### District of Lanterns

They say that nothing is comparable to the District's view at night. Up to the port, the area is surrounded by red lights from the lanterns hanging in the middle of the winding alleyways of the city. In this area you can enjoy excellent liqueurs produced by local traders.

#### The Wizard Routes

Characteristic neighborhood due to the tip-top houses, it is home exclusively to wizards, sorcerers and famous charmers. The houses are awarded to the winners of the Skyreel Tournament, who acquire the right to live in an elegant mansion in this area for the entire duration of their lives.

### Points of interest

#### Sea Court

The ancient stronghold that houses the government of the Grand Council of the Republics is a singular structure, the result of multiple mergers between architectural styles of different races. The centuries-old exposure to salt from the ocean has made its walls multicolored, so much so that the entire structure seems to have just emerged from the waters.

#### Old Harbour

A maze of roads that inevitably lead to the sea. The name indicates the place of the first settlers' landing place, an area that was once salty and rocky. It is famous for its location in New Sun Inn, a majestic stone and wood building that serves as a meeting point for many adventurers on the continent.

#### The First Stone

A small crossroads to the north of the city hosts the First Stone, a black basalt monolith, crossed by bright swirling blue lines. It is believed that the boulder is projecting a magical area capable of relaxing the nerves and calming fears. Many people go to the stone before making important decisions, convinced that monolithic energy can help them unravel thorny issues or difficult decisions.

#### The Consortium

It is a red brick building immersed in an area of merchant warehouses. From here, port security control is organized for ship cargoes operating in the Night Sea, and is a tangle of rooms, common areas, halls filled with cargo, merchants and sailors. The structure also has underground cells to accommodate those accused of crimes by the Republican Court.

#### Auditorium

It is the place where magic shows, events and meetings are held. The structure was erected by the Consortium in 172 CE to celebrate the year of freedom and independence.

## Cities

### Broken Bridge

This pre-colonization stone construction is one of the largest river bridges on the continent. Most likely the current structure is only part of what it was in the past. The bridge, with a single span, owes its name to the fact that if you look at it from the right angle, it seems to be divided into two single pieces, for a strange play of light and perspective. The most imaginative argue that a parallel realm can be reached from it where reality is "broken" like the bridge itself.

### Selvane

The first city south of Damodar is usually populated by former noblemen or old naval commanders. The town is often under close surveillance because not all former commanders of the merchant galleys like a "forced rest" on the ground. Despite these old brawlers who enjoy playing war with small battles between them to the detriment of the poor inhabitants of the city, it is a quiet place.

### Thiros

The city is one of the major shipyards and marshalling yards for marine practices. Here you can find shipyards, harbor masters and all the government structures secondary only to the Damodar Command.

### Yaras

Also called "The Door of Heaven", given its position as a necessary passage to reach Skyreel Island by land, is a city that for years has tried to achieve independence from the Republics. At the moment the city suffers from a subversive social climate and it is not advisable to stay there for short periods.

## Forests

### Kur Woods

A pinewood on the ocean, the forest is very famous for the presence of a group of druids dedicated to the continuous renewal of the flora and fauna of the region. Sometimes druids are asked by the people for medical questions, or gifts are offered to them, brought into the forest with long pilgrimages. Recently, the druids have disappeared due to a group of Vel-Shar fanatics who have taken over large parts of the forest.

### Bluetooth Rivers

They are called "rivers" even though they are actually part of a single stream that flows through the nearby mountains. The estuary to the south feeds the vegetation of the Kur Woods, while to the north it is divided into two other trunks that flow into the ocean. From time to time, the farmers, following the current, notice strange carcasses of animals descending downstream, which makes us think of some settlement near orcs or other wild mountain creatures.

### Golden Forest

The forest south of the village of Tahnur is known as the Golden Forest. In this scrub of green coniferous conifers and broad leafy trees, they say that an ancient dragon dwells, but no one has been able to prove it.

## Sunrise Islands

The archipelago is formed, in addition to the three largest ones, also from small islands or nameless islands. Usually, given their small sizes, they are often deserted, serving more as places of luck waiting for a ship to pass or as places of solitary meditation. However, it is likely that some of them may be able to guard the treasures of some pirate, abandoned or buried.

### Dusken

The lesser of the four islands, Dusken is a place of prayer and meditation. The large lighthouse in the west of the island has for years been a symbol of great conquest dreams. The island is home to a community of former seafaring people and is one of the favorite places for those who are looking for a crew or for those who want to venture out by sea.

### Lightbringer

Also called the Island of the Righteous, it is the seat of many companies of paladins, branch offices of the Dorne Society and other religious groups more or less known.

### Skyreel

The great mountain of the island is one of the favorite observation points for travelers arriving on the Sunrise Islands. From this strategic point you can admire the whole archipelago as far as the city of Yaras inland. The island itself, with its mountains and small woods, is home to a famous Magic Tournament which takes place every five years.

### Sunwatch

Sunwatch is the favourite island for users of arcane arts, almost entirely populated by wizards, sorcerers and enchanters. In the wooded part of the island you can find most of the components for the creation of spells, even the most rare and complex.
