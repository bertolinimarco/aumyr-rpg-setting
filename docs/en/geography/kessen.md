# Kessen

![Banner](/images/banner-kessen.png)

Kessen is the region that lies between the area of Stone Tower to the west, the Feldris peninsula to the south and the Weeping Marshes to the east.
It is a territory largely dominated by the imposing presence of the Cloud Mountains, but you can also find a wide flat territory called Three Rivers Valley, famous for the abundance of harvest.

## Government

Representative Syndicate. The local administration is entrusted directly to the mayors, who govern their own territory as they see fit, in compliance with the law. This figure can only be elected by the people. If the settlement has more than five thousand inhabitants, the Mayor also acquires the power to participate in government decisions. The union's plenary assembly takes place once a year in Feldris and is convened to discuss matters of extraordinary importance.

## War

All the soldiers of the region are known as the Valleys Guard. It is a mercenary company consisting mainly of former criminals and adventurers. Financed by all the cities that ask for their services, they send a garrison to defend the territory to be protected. They are famous for their advanced training and discipline. Guard history is based on an alternative to prison for criminals: enlisting and changing lives is a very common choice, rather than prison for life. The organization, however, has a legal alignment and deals internally with its "problematic members". In exchange for this political and management concession, in the event of war the Kessen government takes over control of the organization.

## Population

The people of Kessen are focused on their own work and, apart from the fishermen on the coast, they prefer to stay beside the home fireplace rather than go to the tavern to share stories. They are famous for their liberalist education system: even if the world is a dangerous place, especially in the shadow of the mountains, young people are often left to themselves, so that they can create their own idea of the world around them. This leads many Kessen people to become intrepid and tenacious adventurers.

## Religion

Although most inhabitants are faithful to the Fives, it is known that there are some minor cults especially among clans and creatures in the mountains.

## Capitals

### Feldris

![Feldris](/images/map-feldris-en.jpg)

Located in the middle of a large plain but not too far from the coast of the Night Sea, Kessen's capital city is blessed by a mild climate almost always due to some warm winds from the gorges of the foggy Mountains. The city districts support a large flow of merchant traffic, both from neighbor coast and countries. The large surrounding expanses offer small hills and pastures with numerous farms and villages scattered everywhere.

#### History

- [41 CE](../chronology/#_41-ce) In recent years, the whole of the Three Rivers Valley is in fact a giant swamp, full of witches, necromancers, criminals, madmen, rejects and solitary hermits. The few who wish to venture into its marshlands have to deal with mysterious creatures, deadly geysers and countless dangers.

- [540 CE](../chronology/#_540-ce) Some giants of nearby Cloud Mountains are caused by the impious magical activities carried out in the marshes and destroy settlements in the valleys. Large boulders fly into the sky, ending up in encampments, villages, ruins and towns, destroying everything. The valleys gradually become fertile soil and the marshy territory withdraws towards the eastern borders of the region.

- [1105 CE](../chronology/#_1105-ce) In these years it is possible to find a first settlement of shepherds and growers given the fertile land and abundant crops. From these years onwards, the area will be intensively farmed on an equal footing with Aumar.

- [1289 CE](../chronology/#_1289-ce) A group of merchants founded the city of Feldris. Few people remember the turmoil of the past and many adventurers help to secure the borders of the region, in the shadow of the foggy Mountains.

#### Districts

##### Lakes District

Most of the inhabitants live in this district, a tangle of narrow streets between lakes, internal squares, vaults, lintels of rough stone and low houses with wooden roofs. In recent years, buying a property in the city has become very simple thanks to a very reasonable pricing policy dictated by the union, with the aim of increasing the city population.

##### The Old Swamp

The area north of the city consists of several layers of reclaimed land that once constituted a large swamp. The area is home to the city's temples, as well as government buildings ancillary to the Syndicate Palace, the city militia's barracks and a large number of taverns for all budgets. Here you can also find the best dwellings in the city: villas and rich noble manor houses with a long history.

##### Silver Waters

So called because of its position close to a large artificial lake with silver water, the district houses the shops of the capital's commercial activities. You can find both alchemists and shops selling magical objects, blacksmiths, carpenters, workshops of master builders, guild sites and more.

#### Points of Interest

##### Syndicate Palace

The large Syndicate building is a historic stone palace consisting of a keep and several towers. It houses the government headquarters as well as several rooms suitable for hosting events, meetings, fairs and banquets. In one of the towers you can consult the town library, an important collection of manuscripts in which to find all kinds of historical, political or arcane information that has been reported in the historical chronicles of the region. The management of the palace is entrusted to an organization employed by the Syndicate and its members act as both supervisors and judges for the city's legal issues.

##### The Old Source

It is an ancient distillery known for the goodness of its mead and currently run by a family of dwarves. The circular central hall accommodates two hundred seats and it is possible to reserve some private rooms in the towers adjacent to the structure. It is thought that a magical spring really exists somewhere under the inn and can be the true source of the goodness of the drinks that are produced here.

##### Rock of Wrath

A great igneous rock that fell here in 540 CE, the remnant of the attacks unleashed by the giants of the mountains. The rock seems to be indestructible and every fire magic thrown near the boulder is enhanced. The children are told that the Rock of Wrath covers the opening of a small tunnel through which it is possible to reach a mysterious cave, seat of a powerful spirit of fire.

##### Ounemu√Øl

An ancient elven cemetery. During the night, he is closed to the public and is guarded by a selected group of elves from the Red Brotherhood. Some old wizards would still like to be buried in this graveyard, even if it is thought that the whole area is subject to some negative influences from the subsoil. During the day you can visit the Eye of the Widow, a splendid white marble mausoleum that contains the tomb of a young elf without name.

##### Shrine of Visions

This temple serves both as a hospital and a refreshment place for many adventurers, but also ordinary citizens. Most minor care is free of charge and the facility is maintained through free donation and support of various divine cults. Inside the rooms it is possible to find a cure for many diseases, both magical and natural, curses, mental conditioning and many other afflictions.

## Cities

### Opur

Once just a miserable fishing village on the coast, Opur has experienced enormous commercial expansion mainly due to the quality and quantity of its fish fauna. Its entire large port is an open-air warehouse and the comings and goings of ships that shuttle to the coasts of Dreamor and the surrounding regions are the order of the day. Many have searched for answers about the unnatural amount of fish present in this area but no one has been able to explain its origin.

### Orros Bridge

A large black stone bridge crosses the Great River and represents the northern border between Kessen and Aumar along the Golden Way. The current structure is the latest in a series of bridges built on site. There are no permanent settlements, apart from the presence of tents of merchants or travel caravans. At any time, the tents can accommodate between twenty and one hundred merchants, travelers or loss of time on either side of the bridge.

### Uvarth

This elliptical settlement once stood in the marshy areas now known as the Wailing Swamp and was one of the most shining examples of elite organic architecture: houses that "grew up" and expanded with the succession of seasons. But the population was not aware of the particular conditions of the subsoil in that area. The foundations sank into the swamp when the bottom broke under the marshland, leaving the population with very little time to save themselves. Today the area is bordered by luminous stones and a large plaque reminds us of the day of disaster.

## Forests

### Shining Source

The place consists of a small valley crossed by one of the tributaries of the Great River. Although there are few trees in the surrounding area, it is a place appreciated for its cool and always spring climate. The name comes from the source of the river, which flows from a shining cave, a characteristic that is given by the brilliance of the mineral rock that reflects the sunlight of the valley.

## Hills

### Horn Hills

On the western border of the region, the Mountains are gradually transformed into a hilly territory, home to numerous clans of wild beasts and trolls. Although it is said that these dark skin trolls have founded their own underground kingdom in the caverns of the hills, the truth is that there are many clans fighting for territorial domination among themselves. Although this is a remarkable shortcut to reach the Aumar and vice versa without passing from Faeland or bypassing the Cloud Mountains, many people prefer not to risk a direct clash with these creatures of the hills.

## Dungeon

### Uduel

Once an archaeological excavation protected by the Council, today it consists of a dungeon with several underground chambers. The Council preferred to keep the tradition of this place alive, organizing every five years, in honor of the gods, a magical competition inside the ruins. Although it is not a real tournament like Skyreel, it is seen by some magicians as an opportunity to gain important contacts within the Council.

## Keeps

### Felmalein

Travelers travelling along the Golden Way leaving Feldris from the West Gate rarely see this hidden structure. It is an almost completely submerged stronghold: the creatures that infest this area never leave the surrounding area and rarely glimpse on the surface, so much so as to suggest that some power can still be alive in its depths invaded by water.

### Stonetower

Many believe that this pile of giant stones is a large open-air tomb for some ancient dwarf rulers. However, there is no evidence to support this hypothesis, apart from the fact that the nearest similar stones are almost two hundred kilometres away. The site is still under archaeological investigation and there is often a settlement of would-be Keepers of Knowledge or students on site.

## Mountains

### Cloud Mountains

The large mountain complex at the centre of the region is formed by the highest peaks on the continent and is known to be home to kobolds, goblins, orcs, frost giants and red dragons. The mountain range is a rugged and steep place, crossed by numerous paths that wind through the caves and mountain passes. At higher altitudes, a dense fog makes it almost impossible to find the path towards the valley, making accidents such as landslides, falls or attacks by creatures inhabiting the recesses frighteningly frequent. Since the valley, you can see numerous volcanic complexes, especially in the central part of the mountains: the whole area is often subject to earthquakes and geological changes and is the ideal place for the proliferation of monsters and other deadly dangers.

## Swamps

### Weeping Marshes

Before flowing directly into the Night Sea, the Great River scatters into a series of swampy areas dotted with cypress trees covered with mosses and lichens. The inhabitants of the surrounding areas are kept away from the more than a thousand square kilometers of the swamp, unless they want to clash with lizard or other creatures that populate it. After the Uvarth disaster, only the tiny village of Yartar survives in the treacherous and muddy areas of the marshland.
