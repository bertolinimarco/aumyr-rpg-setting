# Laangor

![Banner](./images/banner-laangor.png)

Laangor is a term of the Native people whose translation is similar to the Common words "Red Stone".
The region is famous for its quarries, from which stones and crystals with red veins are extracted. These stones are similar to those of the Emerald Mountains and for these reasons it is thought that in ancient times both mountains must have been part of a single gigantic mountain range with multicolored stones. The region is also known for its talented bards and its long history of fallen dynastic monarchies, knights and great wizards, courtesan experts and good wine.

## Government

The government consists of an Assembly of nobles convened monthly. The Assembly is elected both by the nobles of the ancient Houses (falling dynastic families) and by the people, who in turn elect their own representative. Elected nobles, including the representative of the people, discuss and legislate on both major issues such as military strategies, land control, and minor issues such as the administration of justice in the form of citizen courts. It is one of the regions with a system of government that has been politically perfected in years of conflict, and one of the regions with the lowest crime rate on the whole continent (excluding Raven's Cove).

## War

Laangor owns an army whose Generals are descendants of former soldiers of the old families. Experts in war as in politics, often "noble" and "soldier" are used as synonyms. Although war does not play a central role in the region's political and cultural life, no one dares to underestimate the Laangor as a war power in the event of war.

## Population

After having established an advanced form of political government, the population has dedicated itself to handicrafts: it is not surprising that some of the most gifted construction Masters come from Laangor. The children are often initiated into one of the guild arts by their father (librarian, glassmaker, potter master, etc...) while the maidens tend to grow up by mothers, learning the art of house government, weaving, cooking and animal husbandry.

## Religion

Laangor worships the Fives and Native Gods and only rarely the temples are dedicated to other faiths. Many inhabitants are convinced that the Fives have civilized the population of the Natives, bringing culture and reason to a wild and unregulated world.

## Capitals

### Highpine

![Highpine](./images/map-highpine-en.jpg)

The name of the capital derives from the name of the last great family, now decayed. The Highpine House were a powerful dynastic family that ruled the Laangor for many years, before being overwhelmed by the decline of the noble regime and the subsequent political transformation of the region's culture. Today the Castle is the residence of the nobles and seat of the Assembly, a fabulous fortress still largely unexplored and towering on the surrounding landscape, formed by the city itself, with its rich neighborhoods and the numerous cultivated fields of the surrounding farms.

#### History

- [201 CE](../chronology/#_201-ce) The area is home to a large commercial outpost, strategically located near one of the five Aumyr Portals. A group of mercenaries control their trade in goods to other regions.

- [656 CE](../chronology/#_656-ce) A major epidemic erupts which kills a large part of the region's population. The origins of the epidemic remain unknown to date, but some historians suspect that the infection may have had extraplanar origins.

- [821 CE](../chronology/#_821-ce) The Great Plague is cured by a powerful wizard, whose name is not recorded in the historical chronicles. Subsequently, and for almost a thousand years, the city lived an era of splendor and commercial growth. Other families succeed each other in power, such as the Arakis family (powerful magicians and warriors), the Orthen family (strategies and merchants) and the Martell family (druids and healers).

- [1901 CE](../chronology/#_1901-ce) Arrus Highpine, the last noble of the family, is mysteriously killed during a hunting trip in the woods. In the following years, the government of the Assembly took over the Castle.

### Districts

#### Paths of the Houses

An old quarter dotted with rich noble mansions, temples and commercial guild houses as well as many merchant activities. Among its streets you can find many adventurers, historians and scholars, wizards, craftsmen and workshops of master builders. Every year the district's terraces are tinged with banners and tapestries, in memory of the years of government of the Houses.

#### North Quarter

This district is home to most of the people houses, but also to criminals. On the sides of the road that leads to the Citadel, it is possible to see some grates that are part of the sewerage complex that extends under the city. These tunnels are used by criminals to travel secretly between the various city districts.

#### Citadel

It is the neighborhood formed by the Castle and various support structures such as stables, the park and other commercial activities once at the service of the Houses. Although it is not home to an Ã©lite of nobles but only government structures, the area is highly supervised and protected by the city guard, which also contributes to the maintenance of all the main buildings.

### Points of interest

#### Castle of the Houses

The magnificent castle, once the residence of the Royal Houses, is now the seat of the government of the Assembly. Its frescoed and richly decorated rooms contain relics of the past, tapestries, carpets, beautiful furnishings and paintings depicting the many nobles who, in the past, contributed to shaping the history of the region and the city. During the new government's settlement, some old master builders report that they found several walled areas in the basement, probably already made inaccessible in remote years. What is hidden beyond them remains a mystery, since several areas of the castle have been sealed and are not accessible to the public.

#### Greywolf Inn

It is an old monastery converted into an inn. It is a regular meeting place for adventurers, mercenaries and retired soldiers. In the small cloister behind the inn you can find the statue of a large grey wolf who possesses the strange property of repelling even the most powerful spells. Many people think that it is really a great petrified creature.

#### Planar Tower

This fortified structure has always hosted the expert enchanters at the service of the Houses. It is made up of many levels and over time each owner has built a floor above that of his predecessor, until it becomes a tower-like construction. These rooms are accessible through portals accessible only to those who have the key, so that the access to many of them have been forgotten or lost. The Council thinks that the structure is now a large sealed dungeon.

#### The White Chamber

Currently, this large shiny stone house on the edge of the city is used as a burning room and morgue for bodies waiting to be buried. It is a funerary guild run by Matilde Brennil, a human with hard traits and glacial spirit. Few people know that the structure once housed the headquarters of a powerful guild of thieves: its underground tunnels, now walled, have been the site of clandestine operations and many people think that they are still infested with monsters of all kinds.

#### Well of Hope

In a remote area of the city it is possible to glimpse the structure of an ancient well in the middle of a small square. It is recounted how, during the Great Plague of 821 CE, part of the population escaped into the well to reach a vast complex of underground caves, used as an extreme refuge to escape the contagion. Ignoring and fearing of the scourge on the surface, they remained there for years waiting for everything to end. Today the well is sealed and its history is considered only a story to scare children and attract tourists.

## Cities

### Ariadne

It is one of the North Ports. From here, you may embark to the glaciers or more frequently to the Nembus Observatory. I port famous for the oil of some great marine creatures that serves as fuel for candles, potions or even, they say, incendiary bombs.

### Hundres

It is a city formed as a result of exchanges and trades between Highpine, which can be reached through the Beloras Forest, and the surrounding villages. Rich and without an apparent government, it stands as an independent city based on caravan exchanges. It is an important node on the Caravan Route.

### Raven's Cove

If it is true that in Laangor criminality rate is low, it depends on the fact that it is all concentrated in this town. In ancient times, Raven's Cove was a central point of communication for messages from travelling ravens. Today it is an exchange point where you can constantly find adventurers ready to die for some gold coins, but also thieves and people suitable for illegal jobs.

### Thoras

The population of Thoras is made up mainly of poets, bards and all those who want to enjoy every shade of peace and beauty in a sunset. The city is famous for its wondrous landscapes, which face directly onto the Sea of Sunset. It is often possible to see old adventurers who find here the pleasure of the last few years that they still have to live, remembering past adventures. This is not an "old" city: ships often stop in this seaside town and the adventures of sailors returning from the Far East are often material for endless stories.

### Trailstone

An ancient caravan town before Hundres became more famous, also due to its better location, Trailstone seems today to be a largely deserted city. Gust of red sand from the nearby Moon Mountains give the landscape a rare but magical appearance, where every year the stone and wood houses are swallowed by wind and time.

## Forests

### Greenfield

A meeting point for caravans, Greenfield is exactly what is expected: green meadows home to numerous merchant camps, a maze of more or less large wagons (which also serves as a large market) where you can find rest and supplies during the trips and, for those who own enough money, an armed escort. In the area is always present at least one merchant, given the high number of adventurers passing through, always looking to trade.

### Beloras Forest

This large forest, which covers about one third of the entire region, is mainly made up of evergreen pines and trees. A place of summer walks due to the breezes given by the winds of the nearby sea, it is also sadly famous for having been the scene of clashes between some communities of elves and humans over the centuries. Even if the trade route from Hundres to Highpine is safe, nobody can know what lies in the depths of the forest.

## Dungeons

### Redstones Cave

It is the main mine in the region, from which the famous stones with fire red veins are extracted. The cave is a labyrinth of tunnels, some very ancient (it is said that they date back to the times of the domination of the dwarves). Although most of the mine is safe and explored, there are many who, armed with a torch and a few rations, have never returned from some new unexplored tunnel. Legends speaks of goblins, kobolds and other larger creatures that would dwell in some dungeons below mine levels.

## Keeps

### Darkwind Castle

Once an even larger fortress than Highpine and home to the Darkwind family, the castle is now owned by a noble local who uses the fortress as a place of entertainment and often exclusive banquets for his famous guests. The nobleman is often forced to change servants because a legend says that in the deep crypts of the castle still lives a powerful and ancient curse.

## The Houses

The Houses of Laangor are powerful dynastic families who over the centuries have allied or clashed to share control of the entire region. Their vicissitudes have been the subject of many events in the history of Laangor, and some traces of their shining past still live on today in the form of properties, castles and objects, but also heirs and characters of noble lineage.
