# Zeitan

![Banner](/images/banner-zeitan.png)

Zeitan is the territory between the Peaks of the Mind to the West and the Horn of Storm to the Northeast. Although it is famous for its numerous mountains, the region is characterized by a large number of biomes such as swamps, plains, hills and even a central lake. The region is often a destination for those who want to admire the architecture of the floating villages in the Moorson Swamps, the singularity of the mountain valleys of the Tempest Horns, or the mysteries of the Mind Peaks.

## Government

The Zeitan government is an absolute hereditary monarchy. King Kormonth IV, an elderly warrior, sits on the throne of the Great Hall of Nordur. In ancient times it may have been one of the strongest fighters on the continent, but today it is only a tired man on an uncomfortable throne, surrounded by conspiracies. Adventurers of various extraction have fought for power control, but the King always seems to find strength when it comes to keeping his place in government.

## War

Zeitan's armies are under the direct control of the monarchy. In peacetime, the soldiers act as city guards, street judges and in general resolve disputes between the inhabitants, with the King's consent. Even if they perform a guiding function, the King always has the last word. The militia does not hesitate to use brute force to resolve brawls or clashes. Among them are divided into ranks according to length of service and there is rarely a lack of military discipline.

## Population

The population of Zeitan is used to dealing with foreigners who visit its territories and there are numerous races that have colonized the region. In the various villages of Zeitan you can find dwarf governments, blacksmiths Elves, Halfling groomers and half-elf shopkeepers. Everyone tends to be sociable and equally dedicated to drinking. There are no distinctive traits for the inhabitants, and this often leads to numerous discussions on various paternity problems.

## Religion

The population worships all the Gods, but in this region there are higher percentages of atheists than in the whole continent. Those who choose this route are seen as wicked, as if the absence of a creed had some influence on the population of the whole territory. Someone thinks that the massive presence of atheists leads divinities to lower the amount of attention dedicated to Zeitan, contributing to populate the dungeons of monsters, undead and other terrible creatures.

## Capitals

### Nordur

![Nordur](/images/map-nordur-en.jpg)

Also known as the "City on the Stakes" or "The Suspended City", Nordur is a large settlement populated mainly by half-elves, halflings and mixed races. It is formed by large barges connected to each other and suspended on the swamp with stilts and large old trunks. Given the impervious nature of the terrain that prevents any attack by land, there are no outer walls and in the annals there is no trace of any relevant event of attack on the city. The rich population is concentrated in the city centre, leaving the poor on the outskirts of the city to form a dilapidated barracks area called "The District", which is also the true heart of the city.

#### History

- [64 CE](../chronology/#_64-ce) The first testimonies of an outpost of the Council, which discovered in this area minerals and vegetables interesting for the treatment of some diseases, date back to this date.

- [790 CE](../chronology/#_790-ce) The annals report clues that lead one to think of a hidden control of the city by a coven of Grey Witches, settled in the large swamps north of the region. It is written that during these years the inhabitants were in the prey of paranoia and madness, while the power of the Witches drove people to kill each other.

- [813 CE](../chronology/#_813-ce) The coven disappears after a group of heroes defeats the Witches in their shelters. The city government is then handed over to the remaining population.

- [1979 CE](../chronology/#_1979-ce) The area of the swamp widens and the central territory begins to solidify, thanks to the compound of mud and ashes of the dead. The ritual area is formed, endowed with powerful divine energies.

#### Districts

##### The District

It is the outer district of the city, where you can find both shops and huts of clerics and druids. The population density is also concentrated in this area, which joins many passing adventurers and beggars.

##### Ritual Area

Located south-east of the city, this area is characterized by the presence of countless layers of land formed by ashes of the dead, which make the area dense with arcane and divine powers. It is said that during the night, many spirits are wandering because of this great mound, sensitive to the call of the living and the memory of themselves still alive.

##### Vines Quarter

The whole area is infested with greenish roots, bulbs and vines. It is made up of shacks and huts anchored on rocky ground, almost like claws trying to escape the mudflats on which they are anchored. In addition to commercial facilities, here you can find shops and even old noble houses, saved from the time and corruption of the mephitic fumes of the place.

#### Points of Interest

##### Great Hall

A domed ebony wood building, home to the government of the region. Inside there are assemblies and political councils: the hall is built using polished stone, brick, wood and is decorated with beautiful tapestries.

##### The Three Sisters

This large workshop is located on the top of a big root wrapped in creepers. Inside you can find potions, filters, alchemical compounds and ingredients for spells. It is run by three human sisters and they are said to know many ways to handle curses, afflictions, debilitations and illnesses.

##### Arcadia

In the North-West quarter of the city you can glimpse the Arcadia, the semi-submerged wrecked ship. Not even the most wise men know the real history of this place, and the ship is so deteriorated that it is no longer able to sail again. The interior of the wreck was converted into a tavern some time ago and it is possible to stay in one of the rooms-cabins that once constituted the passenger section.

##### Cave of Lights

It is a complex of caves with walls covered by luminous lichens, possible conductors of bioluminescence of the flora of the subsoil. It was once an asylum due to the soothing effect of some rooms), now it's a ghetto for marginalized and crazy people. Those who stay there are called Absorbed: they often express themselves through gestures and do not seem to have a leader.

##### Dreamer's Rock

A strange stone monolith emerges at the corner of a street in the District. It is about two meters high, covered with an evanescent and gelatinous substance that does not seem to react to any external manipulation. Some people think that it is an ancient blasphemous monument erected by some worshippers of a dead lizard God, others think that it is a magical focus useful to cross the Dreamlands.

## Cities

### Fel-Doras

One of the cultural outposts of the Elves, Fel-Doras is a city made up of richly decorated palaces, public arenas, hanging gardens, cisterns, fountains and many other decorative structures. The city is in the middle of several kilometers of desolation and is probably fueled by underground sources. The sages claim that the city was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Natives before the great exodus to Inkari.

### Innerdale

Merchant port of Zeitan, Innerdale is famous for fine fabrics from all over the continent, rare spices, and even rarer alchemical substances. Situated on the border between Zeitan, Merosh and Laangor, it is a great place to find "special" goods that escape the control of the monarchy.

### Zaldar

It is the second largest city in Zeitan. It is an alternative for those who don't feel like living on stilts suspended on the swamp as in the capital. Some of Nordur's nobles have control over the town, once a summer destination for the Kings. Large gardens, villas on the ocean, fields cultivated by small landowners: Zaldar seems to be almost out of place compared to the bleak climate of the capital.

## Dungeons

### Morius

Many adventurers claim that anyone who plunges into the waters of a spring at the bottom of a secret cave, at the end of a dangerous dungeon under the Mind Peaks called Morius, becomes immune to any damage for several days. If the spring water is drunk, it guarantees immunity to damage for a few hours. It is also said that in the dungeon there is the lair of an ancient white dragon.

## Keeps

### Void Citadel

Located on a promontory in the middle of the Samard Valley peaks, the Void Citadel is a fortified settlement formed by a bastion of black and obsidian basalt, with numerous pointed towers that rise threateningly above the surrounding landscape. Although the whole area seems to have appeared directly from hell, it is a safe haven for travelers and pilgrims who come to Zeitan in search of rest and refuge. It is an interplanar free harbor and it is thought to be a sort of "bridge" city between Aumyr and the other Planes. The citadel is governed by a globular spirit, a strange ethereal creature who observes the city from the top of one of the towers. It is a safe place for refreshment, although many adventurers consider the numerous activities of the Citadel to be only a cover to conceal much darker and mysterious purposes.

### Faux Edge

This large structure that stands in the northernmost point of the whole continent, it is rumored to be an ancient monastery. Its location makes it very difficult to reach, and the north winds threats the soul and body of those who try to walk along the very dangerous path through the ice. Sometimes, some talented hero is encouraged by the elders of the nearby villages to walk along the winding path to the fortress, to try to understand if the place is still inhabited and what dwellings inside its inner rooms. Nobody has ever returned.
