# Nordavind

![Banner](/images/banner-nordavind.png)

Nordavind is the region of northern men, seasoned sailors, fishermen and hard workers whose ships are often seen docking on the coasts of the known world.
The territory is often a harsh, cold and inhospitable place, as well as its people, mountaineers with snow even in the bones. The valleys, fjords and mountain passes are known to be populated by giants, dragons and other powerful frost creatures. Isolated groups of elves and dwarves are allocated to wild regions, but rarely tend to relate friendly with visitors. Most people are concentrated in the outposts, the only places where you can cultivate some land and find resources to spend long seasons in the mountains.

## Government

The population of Nordavind is governed by dozens of Kings and Chieftains, many of whom are at war with each other. Every now and then, a great leader comes to unite the population under one banner, but several years have passed since the last time it happened.

## War

The kingdom of Nordavind does not have a regional army. Instead, each head of Clans keeps his own Honor Guard. The combat is so central in the life aspect of every Nordavind inhabitant that almost all adult males are able to become soldiers in times of war. Warriors are typically dressed in iron helmets, leather armor or chainmail, and round shields. Their preferred weapons include the spear (close range or close range), the long sword and the battle axe. A rare elite of warriors is also able to develop a battle frenzy that turns into an ability called The Bloodfury, which allows them to increase their strength in proportion to the bloodshed of which they are protagonists. Success means that the warrior falls into a state that is unfamiliar for a few days, while failure causes death.

## Population

The culture of Nordavind is centered around war and survival in the frost lands. Nordavind is perhaps the only region that is not completely under the control of the Council, or aware of modern political and governance issues in the continent lands. People are usually very strong and healthy. Men are fierce fighters and women live mainly at home, but they have no problems to join the men in times of war. Loyalty, honor and family are celebrated values.

## Religion

The Nordavind knows the Fives, but most believers prefer to pay tribute to Hardon as their main god.

## Capitals

### Dunmere

![Dunmere](/images/map-dunmere-en.jpg)

The city is a large settlement of steep and pointed rooftop houses, an oasis of civilization in the wild mountains. Situated in a natural gorge that protects it from the raids of most nearby mountain creatures, in Dunmere people focus on farming and hunting, but also fighting in public arenas to prove their worth, trade or simply drink mead.

#### History

- [231 CE](../chronology/#_231-ce) Some Wolfguard explorers discover that the area is the domain of Orog-Mar, a powerful orchard chief of the mountains.

- [830 CE](../chronology/#_830-ce) A group of barbarians led by hero Beonur destroy the orcs of the mountains in their outpost. The event will be remembered as the hero's last great achievement before his retreat in Greytower.

- [1541 CE](../chronology/#_1541-ce) A former adventurer, Korm Modan, founds The Ember. The site is the first base camp for the organization of expeditions to the nearby mountains, a protected and safe shelter.

- [1762 CE](../chronology/#_1762-ce) Some clans of mountain barbarians and old warriors settle in a mountain valley and help found Dunmere. Construction of the Hall of Heroes began in memory of all those who gave their lives for the freedom of the clans and the population.

### Districts

#### The Frozen Mantle

The western part of the city is dedicated to agriculture and the harvesting of many crops that find ideal terrain in cold and frozen climates. Many people choose to settle close to this area in order to cultivate their own land and also sustain themselves commercially, considering that food in the mountains is a rare and precious resource.

#### Trial Trails

A large fenced area on the edge of the city is used as a venue for the Trial, a sort of initiatory walk for the young warriors of Dunmere. Those who want to join the city's society by right must face this initiation path. It is said that the test can change depending on the personality of the person facing it: many lose their hindsight and return afflicted by early dementia, or worse. Others change personality or character. Legend has it that during the Trial, the great hero Beonur guides all the Young Wolves to a deep understanding of themselves.

#### Maul Quarters

The south-east part of the city is home to blacksmiths, carpenters, hammers and metalworkers from the nearby mountains. At any time of day you can feel the heavy thunder of sweaters on the metal, fed by small springs of water from the mountain glacier.

### Points of interest

#### Hall of Heroes

Those who enter this place for the first time feel as though they are being watched by the dozens and dozens of busts set in the walls of rough stone, depicting great heroes of the past. The rooms host the government of the region, comfortable accommodation for diplomats and important personalities, circular rooms where meetings can be held and even a large library of parchments about the history of Nordavind.

#### The Ember

It is a large grey stone manor, containing several rooms and a huge circular fireplace in the centre of the main hall. The fire is known to be always on, serving legendary meat and meals. On a wall you can see a portrait of Kor Modan, former adventurer and founder of the tavern: a large human with hardened traits and gray beard, wrapped in numerous bear skins.

#### Crystal Caves

A vast complex of caves that open on the sides of the mountain near the city. In its tunnels you can see large multicolored crystals, groups of glossy gemstones and various calcareous formations. If properly treated, some of the crystals may give unique magical abilities or enhance innate abilities. Many city dwellers are convinced that crystals bring fortune, so it is not uncommon to witness marriages and celebrations of various kinds held inside the caves.

#### Temple of the Three Truths

An order of wizards finds its home in this strange building on the edge of the city. The whole structure seems to have nothing to do with the houses of wood and stone covered in snow: it is a tower with spirals in blackish shades, carved directly into the mountain. The acolytes of the Temple are hermits who rarely leave the walls of their seat, except for making provisions or to dispense enigmatic advice to adventurers who try to be welcomed in the tower.

#### Giant's Rock

The easiest way to reach this structure is to use an old elevator consisting of a metal cabin hooked to a large self-propelled cable. During the steep ascension route it is possible to understand the origin of the name of this place: it is a cave carved into a rock face, resembling the mouth of a giant mountain giant. Inside, you can find a hall of the Dorne Society, formed by a group of expert mountaineers and guides ready to help adventurers in danger, or to explore some of the many dungeons that hide among the Frost Peaks.

## Cities

### Endur

Very few people stay for long time in Endur. It is said that it has become a port of pirates and a small organized crime centre and that a guild of murderers has control of the city.

### Hilden

A sea outpost, it is the main source of trade by sea in the region. Merchant ships and often pirate ships arrive in these docks. It is not a particularly safe place, but you can find mercenaries willing to anything in exchange for gold coins.

### Icegate

The "North Gate" is a large outpost created to guard accesses to the mountains. Built on a rock spur from which you can enjoy a unique foothill landscape, the city is often frequented by powerful representatives of the Wolfguard, rangers, explorers and adventurers, as well as cattle traders, tanners and miners.

### Meremar

The traveler who arrives in the city has noticed that it represents only the shadow of past splendors. The heart of the settlement is the Old Dock, now an immense ship cemetery. Now it is populated by prostitutes, taverns, pirates and gamblers.

## Islands

### Voros Peninsula

The Tight Bridge connects the North Sea with this peninsula to the east. An ancient settlement of shipbuilders, today the peninsula is "the part of Nordavind without the mountains". For the local population, it is a place where smugglers can sort goods before they move them elsewhere or sell them. The peninsula is however extensive and can boast numerous villages and interesting places.

## Mountains

### Skard Pass

The route through the Frost Peaks is dotted with caves and mountain passages where goblin, orcs and troll groups have their lairs.

### Kharnat Peak

As the highest mountain of the Frost Peaks, Kharnat is known to be the nest of various creatures, griffins, dragons and perhaps even something older, hidden inside the inaccessible mountain.

## Keeps

### Greytower

This fortress was once the place from where Beonur, one of the strongest warriors of all Aumyr, gathered the Clans under one banner. After its defeat by a coalition of rebel wizards, it is said that this stronghold is now the eternal dwelling place of the spirits of all those who perished during the battle between the two factions.
