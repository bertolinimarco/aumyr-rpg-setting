# Faeland

![Banner](/images/banner-faeland.png)

This large territory between Myrdon Bay and the Nayalis Forest is characterized by the presence of numerous settlements more or less populated scattered for its great extension.
The presence of one of the three Observatories on the coast also makes it one of the favorite destinations for Askari scholars.

## Government

Meritocracy. Faeland has seen many forms of government, until a few decades ago, when the people, tired of seemingly endless political anxiety, chose to subvert the elite of power and to constitute a system of government where administrative, public and any role requires responsibility towards others, is entrusted according to criteria of merit, not belonging to lobbying, family or income. Faeland is in fact the dream of every individualist. The work is entrusted according to criteria of experience and competence, and almost everyone plays their part. A group of wise men called the Fair Council, elected according to meritocratic criteria, oversees administrative and government operations. Anyone can be a member of the Equal Council, provided that he or she demonstrates his or her superiority in terms of wisdom, discernment, fairness and intelligence in relation to the essays that compose it.

## War

The soldiers in the region are people who choose to take up the profession of town watchdog or village defender, and so on. There is no real army, but in the event of war the Fair Council will determine how many and which people it proposes to defend the territory, according to their skills and abilities.

## Population

The variety of population due to the dynamic and unique form of government in the region makes Faeland a very attractive place for various activities. Many adventurers choose Faeland as their starting point for their business and adventurers are held in high regard, dedicating themselves to overcoming their physical and mental limits.

## Religion

The region worships the Fives and all religions (except for the chaotic ones, such as Vel-Shar), are generally tolerated and represented with temples and votive altars scattered throughout the settlements of the region. The management of problems related to chaotic cults is entrusted to members of the Council or the Red Brotherhood.

## Capitals

### Elerin

![Elerin](/images/map-elerin-en.jpg)

Elerin is known as the "Mirror City". The octagon structure contains the large "Nucleus", a fortified circular structure in the middle. This area is also the city centre where commercial activities are located. The "mirror" is an illusion that one feels when one looks at the city from the top of the nearby mountains: if one were ideally to divide in half and overlap the two sides of the city, one part would be perfectly coincident with the other half, almost as if they were two duplicate parts. In the taverns of some bards, they are often asked to sing "The Two Faces", a sort of philosophical poem about the importance of equity.

#### History

- [397 CE](../chronology/#_397-ce) In the area it is possible to find an outpost of fishermen built on another ancient settlement of probable Askari origin, considering the numerous finds found and catalogued by the Dorne Society.

- [676 CE](../chronology/#_676-ce) During an excavation, the Great Wheel is found and brought to light, as well as numerous fragments of unknown metal. The findings are of particular interest to the Council, which hastens to oversee the area.

- [1120 CE](../chronology/#_1120-ce) The city is founded. A joint effort between the knowledge of the Council and the Dorne Society helps to reconstruct part of the Great Wheel, which is used to cover the core.

- [1557 CE](../chronology/#_1557-ce) A group of magicians founded the Highspire School. Historians write about how the entire building, in the form of a flame, appeared from a portal as a result of an unknown ritual.

#### Districts

##### The Nucleus

The large fortified structure in the centre of the city houses the government headquarters, numerous temples, commercial activities and elegant houses. In case of attack, this structure as large as a neighborhood can be closed like a cocoon, covered by a large shiny dome.

##### Independent Quarter

It is a part of the city controlled by a group of citizens called "Independentists". Autarchy is in its streets and the city government allows the area to regulate itself. Visitors to the neighborhood immediately notice the absence of guards and militia, but the Independent people are far from being uninvolved.

##### Port of Souls

So called because of its position close to the Sea of Souls, the area is dotted with many shops, shipyards and warehouses full of goods. The port is a place of exchange, receiving stolen goods, agreements, gossip, subterfuges and secrets.

#### Points of Interest

##### Highspire

So called because of its unique shape, Highspire is the most expensive and austere school of magic on the continent. For centuries, its classrooms have been making exceptional spells and many think that it provides an even more complete preparation than the Gray Academy of Fivestar. This school is famous for not having (or imposing) any limitations on the use of arcane arts, whether they are intended to be beneficial or evil. Attending Highspire's classes is a privilege for a few, given the very high cost of his courses and the absurdly difficult entry exams. It is said that the teaching group is composed above all of adventurers and that the Headmaster is a member of the mysterious Order of Gnosis.

##### The Great Wheel

Many people think that this huge, glittering toothed wheel is part of a gigantic ancient machinery now forgotten. The Great Wheel allows the dome to move and close above the Core, protecting the city's central district if necessary. It is said that the material it is made of is indestructible, as is the dome itself.

##### Aureum

The large circular building with its four towers bears witness to the grandeur and power of the organization known as Mercatus. In this structure it is possible to carry out monetary operations: deposit money, borrow money, keep assets and valuables, convert treasures into gold coins and more. The staff members responsible for the supervision and control of this structure are called "Aureum agents".

##### The Windrose

A odd inn is located in the Port of Souls area. The Windrose always guarantees entertainment: whether it's drinks, songs, stories of the sea and brawls among patrons. It is also possible to find all sorts of adventurers who sit at the unbalanced tables at any given time, a perfect place where you can get boat trips to the other regions of the continent or even further afield. The inn offers discounted prices to old sea wolves, smugglers, captains of vessels and buccaneers of all kinds.

##### Xomaxan

A small, semi-invisible internal square is also known as The Court of Silence. The area is just over 300 square meters large. The whole square is a zone of dead magic and no spell can be successfully cast. Many wizards have tried to understand the reasons for this arcane oddity and even the Council has sent here some brilliant students in search of answers over the years, but nothing has been worth the attempts to discover the reasons or history of this particular area.

## Cities

### Devine

Built on the banks of an artificial lake simply called "Lake Devine", this town has been the target of numerous raids of creatures from the mountains to the north. In 2370 CE, the situation improved thanks to the construction of a large observation tower and the presence of a permanent garrison of Son of Hardon. The land surrounding the city is uncultivated, apart from a few green areas on the shores of the lake. The inhabitants are in close contact with the nearby villages, but above all with the Avan outpost, with which they share the lake's fish stocks.

### Iratar

Also known as The Crossroad, the town was built on a small hill overlooking the surrounding area. It is famous for its bizarre architecture: wide and low semi-underground houses, dwellings built on top of each other, and other quirks. On the square there is an ancient structure called Twin Mausoleums: these are two large temples with a circular shape, united by a small central corridor. Inside there is a museum dedicated to the fauna of Aumyr, maintained by the Dorne Society. In the northern part of the city you will find The Phoenix's Song, a large inn-temple dedicated to Melian. There are also rumors that a famous adventurer, a member of the Order of Gnosis, is hiding in this city, able to predict the future and build wonderful objects never seen before.

### Oloruth

It is an old mining settlement formed by a collection of stone houses with red roofs. Surrounded by a large ancient wall still intact, the city is known for the mastery of its blacksmiths, able to combine steel with arcane magic: it is a place very popular with adventurers looking for a reliable weapon, at the right price.

### Riordan

The city is located on a high ridge and you can only reach it through a lift at the base, which raises goods and people for more than 30 meters. This ancient mechanical work exists thanks to the inventions of a certain inventor named Germag Rox, but nobody can remember anything else than his name. The elevator still works and is virtually maintenance-free, thanks to the almost indestructible gold and silver alloy strings. Going up to the city you can stop at The Two Chests, the town inn famous for its unique liquor and special properties called "Naqatl".

## Dungeon

### Blackspring Mines

An ancient gold and silver elf mine, Blackspring Mine is now a network of flooded and abandoned galleries. Even if the fabulous quantities of gold of the past ages are no longer extracted, some veins still contain enough minerals to be the object of continuous excavations by the people of the surrounding villages, convinced to find enormous secrets left by the elves.

## Keeps

### Firemag Castle

This ancient lava stone castle still stands intact on the slopes of the mountains. It is possible to see it from great distances, and its fame makes it a fearsome place for even the most experienced adventurers. Originally the seat of an ancient organization of magicians dedicated to the demonic pacts, it was the object of "reclamation" on several occasions by the Council. Today it seems to be the seat of a group of wizards with elemental powers, but it is not clear that they are present in mass inside the Castle.

### City of Dawn

Although the name may evoke images of a magnificent shining castle, the City of the Dawn is a very dangerous place. The goddess Vel-Shar chose this place two centuries ago to erect a majestic dwelling, symbol of her power over the undead. The spells cast some time ago had to be very powerful because the structure doesn't seem to be aged for a day: a large central keep and a triangular wall form an area to which only approach one feels a sense of nausea and discomfort. Currently the structure is often a pilgrimage destination for pilgrimages of the members of the Vel-Shar's Will, and has been converted into an archaeological site, even if it is thought that it can still be a place of hidden gathering for the initiates of the goddess.

### Myrdar Fortress

Unlike than a fortress, Myrdar is now a collection of large stones and ruins. The pentagonal shaped area is formed by a colonnade and a well in the central courtyard: even if the well has been walled, some wayfarers swear that they have heard some strange voices coming from underground.
