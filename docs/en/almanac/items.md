# Items

## Artifacts

They are unique objects, lost or preserved as immense treasures in some remote location. They can be used by the Master as key objects of campaigns or epic adventures.
Given their great power, they could play a key role in the history and events of the world. Their location is unknown and many adventurers devote their whole lives to the search for a great lost artifact.

### Askarian Staff

Rod/Stick, unbreakable. It is a small metal alloy rod inlaid with unknown glyphs. The stick has two forms, one "closed" and the other "open". Depending on its size, it has different functions. When closed, it is 40cm long and can be used similarly to a torch (illuminates at one end). Opened, it becomes a rod that can be extended up to 2 meters, making it particularly useful when it comes to climbing a rock face or overcoming other obstacles.

### Chalice of Melian

Wooden chalice with golden upper edge. Because of its humble and simple nature, it is difficult to distinguish it from a common chalice for its clerical functions; this makes it one of the rarest and most desired objects by crowds of adventurers and worshippers of Melian. Allows you to create blessed water at will (maximum 1 liter per hour). Drinking water heals from every wound or illness. If used on a dead body, it resists it as under the influence of Resurrection magic, provided that it has died not more than 24 hours). In the hands of a follower of Melian can be used as a sacred relic. It emits daylight within a radius of 10 meters. The Chalice can also be used as a necromantic focus, if suitably cursed through a complex and sacrilegious ritual. In this case, its power manifests itself in the opposite direction: the water generated is transformed into a colorless poison that kills every creature who drinks it and wounds those who touch it, in addition, the glass itself acquires other unknown and obscure powers.

### Dogma

Tower Shield. A shield apparently worn out but carved with great skill. The inner part is equipped with a chain mechanism that allows it to be easily fastened to the armor or to the armor glove. The outer part, on the other hand, is made up of a dragon-shaped carving in the shape of a dragon's head, as well as a series of circles wrapped around it, written in an unknown language. Generate anti-magic field that protects an extra person in addition to the bearer. It makes those who wield it immune from the breath of dragons and mental conditioning, sleep and fear.

### Mirror Fragments

Small pieces of colored glass of various sizes. They are said to be part of a large mirror destroyed and dispersed, with legendary powers. If one of the fragments is put in contact with a mirror surface, this will become a portal for the World of Mirrors, a dimension parallel to the Material Plane, but opposite and very strange. Opening a portal to this dimension is risky: the mere knowledge of the World of Mirrors has killed or made many adventurers crazy.

### Gloves of Creation

Unknown leather gloves with numerous reinforcements in a copper-like metal alloy. Artifact of Askari origin, currently dispersed and object of multiple arcane and divine speculations. It is thought to be a device for manipulating the matter of creation itself.

### Blade of the Deep Night

Long sword. Forged in the lower levels of Gherzul and imbued with his magical energy. If a critical blow is made, its sacrilegious power instantly kills any creature as long as it is mortal.

### Death Lantern

A small brass and iron lantern, whose gleam seems to be fueled by a form of energy different from fire. The strange green light of the flame identifies objects, discovers secret doors, reveals illusions, reveals invisible beings or on the Ethereal Plane. It is a cursed object, however. Every time someone turns the lantern on, someone, somewhere in the world, dies. There is a possibility that the person is close to the person who turns it on. It can be used as a focus for necromantic spells, increasing their power considerably.

### Eternal Light

Long Compound Bow, Anathema of the Undeads and Outsiders. It appears as an intricate and curved knotty wooden staff, pervaded with tenuous energy. In the dark, it shines red. If it is held in the centre, a fine reddish energy beam is generated connected to the two ends of the staff, forming a curved arc. Arrows of all kinds can be fired, or if used without arrows, the arc generates its own light arrow. The arrows thus generated are endless and dissolve after hitting the target.

### Savas Mantle

Long dark green hood. The inner side of the coat is a smooth, matt fabric similar to silk satin. The exterior is slippery and changes its pigmentation according to the surrounding environment, making it difficult for the wearer to identify in a wild environment. The wearer can camouflage himself in natural landscapes, become invisible, change form once a day (provided that he does not exceed his size), understand and speak all languages.

### Flamebiter

Silver alloy maul. The hammer head may emit a flaming flame and generate light within 20 metres. It can be used as a smithy hammer: any weapon forged or repaired with it acquires the properties of a magic weapon. It is considered by many blacksmiths to be the greatest treasure of metallurgy and advanced knowledge of Askari.

### Energy Node

Cube of 30cm per side, made of quartz-like polished stone. An ancient Askari tool that allows you to collect elemental energy to store it as a source of energy, as a battery. Through some practices it is possible to use an Energy Node to power structures, alchemical laboratories, heat sources and other plants that require elemental or arcane energy. Many people think that the Portals are powered by these ancient and powerful objects.

### Obsidian Skull

A odd talking skull, it represents a slightly elongated human head. In the lateral part of the skull, you can see some inscriptions engraved with precision in the stone. It can be used by asking with some questions about future events concerning who uses it. The answers are cryptic and can easily be misunderstood, but it always tell the truth. A question can be asked daily by any creature in any language, the skull will always answer, possesses a neutral will and cannot be destroyed (at least not in a conventional way).

### Vests of Knowledge

A series of arcane vestments of great value, often woven through magic and donated as an honor to great wizards or enchanters. Because of their arcane nature, they can only be worn by those who practice arcane magic. They give a bonus to the defense, making it difficult to hit the wearer. They allow to ignore the use of material components for casting spells.
