# Characters

Aumyr is a world of endless stories and tales, teeming with mysteries and magic. From simple country voices to heroic deeds, there are many adventurers who have contributed to shaping the history of the continent, whether they are legendary heroes or cursed.
The discovery of the Portals has made the world the scene of discoveries, events, battles and achievements. Some heroes have powers or artifacts that can overturn the balance of magic, others weave in the shadows waiting to possess enough power to create their own place in history. Everyone can find their destiny on Aumyr, as long as they are eager enough to look for it.

## Famous Characters

### Altus

Many believe that Altus is the most powerful known human being. Archmage, known Member of the Order of Gnosis and Chosen of Normod, his inquisitive and conservative methods have made him popular with enchanters, wizards and sorcerers, to the point of becoming an Elder Member of the Council Inner Circle. Conservative, he is convinced that magic knowledge should only be used by a few elected representatives.

In 2231 CE Altus is just another poor human orphan in the service of Quiron Zandar, an old perverse wizard. After many years spent in extreme territories in search of rare arcane ingredients, one night, a powerful arcane ritual kills Zandar and Altus manages to save himself escaping from his hidden tower. For many years he became an adventurer, a vagabond and offered his services as a mercenary. His efforts to broaden the knowledge of magic in all directions make him become Chosen of Normod, which lengthens his life but freeze his temperament.

Altus is inflexible and liked to pursue his own personal code of conduct. He dedicated his life to the study of the enigmas of arcane and divine magic, eventually believing that it, as an emanation of ancient knowledge, should be used only by a few chosen ones.

### Avonder

Those who cross this bizarre character, report that they are faced with a human being of average size and age, of good appearance and apparently without any particular signs, perhaps dedicated to the search for "various objects" or completely alienated from the rest of the world and devoted to the study of some artifacts with strange magical properties.

Avonder doesn't really like talking about himself. He prefers to be vague about his origins, even though his bloodline seems to be somehow linked to the union of a sorcerer and a nymph in the woods. Independent from every point of view and despite its natural tendency to be a lonely and contemplative type, it doesn't disdain any adventure or some nice drink in company. His dual nature and his strange passions contribute to making him bizarre in the eyes of so many people, but they also give him a deep esteem among the people who really know him. His "old acquaintances" are not rare, even in remote places or on the Exterior Plains, and someone murmurs to have seen him several times in the company of very influential characters.

As a Member of the Order of Gnosis, Avonder is mainly dedicated to the research and documentation of various objects that are created by an Arcanist who has included powers. The aim is to create a sort of archive with instructions to duplicate and improve the knowledge of the Order, raise awareness among the people of Aumyr about the Arcanists and raise awareness among the masses of the use of magic, even practical.

### Arak-Thorak

No other native hero has achieved the same legendary fame throughout world history since the Arrival of the Five as Arak-Thorak The Dragonrider. Many Native warriors consider him one of the Great Father's few prophets, a brutal warrior enlightened by an insane religious fervour. It is said that he loved to generate terror on the battlefield by unleashing destruction at the head of a group of dragons. Legend has it that he is buried under the city of Khoralis in a large secret tomb full of treasures, traps and deadly creatures.

### Argonos

Of noble birth and by many considered a valiant warrior, he stands out as a brave adventurer helping to free Damodar from the control of a powerful group of pirates of the Sea of Night. Argonos was later crowned King of the largest commercial and maritime port on the continent, as a reward for his work. Contrary to what his noble lineage would suggest, some think that in the past Argonos was a powerful pirate and that he used his political knowledge to climb the ranks of Damodar's power. Some adventurers are convinced that old Argonos hid a huge treasure in some port in the Sea of Night.

### Arrus Highpine

The last true noble pureblood of the Houses, Arrus Highpine was a famous diplomat and ruler of the Laangor region and also the last descendant of the family from which he takes his surname. He went down in history as both a philosopher and a warrior, and his ability to predict the enemy's moves on the battlefield created quite a few problems for his adversaries. He was killed on a hunting trip in the woods surrounding the capital, in a plot long woven by the enemies of the Houses and the independentists. The event also marked the official end of the reign of the Houses of Laangor.

### Arvath Lindale

One of the most famous figures among adventurers is undoubtedly the great explorer Arvath Lindale. Famous throughout Aumyr for being among the discoverers of the myth of the ancient Askari, Lindale is remembered in stories, songs, ballads, frescoes, novels and many other artistic works, often immortalized in epic scenarios and dungeons as ancient as the world itself. His last discovery, before his mysterious disappearance in 1566 CE, was the discovery of the ancient Askari Ruin of Lornat, a wonderful place where, it is said, the destiny can be revealed. Today only a few fragments of his numerous expeditionary diaries, preserved by the Council, remains.

### Beonur

A mighty barbarian hero, Beonur represents the fighting essence of the mountain people of Nordavind. In the year 830 CE, while the region is invaded by hordes of monsters from the inaccessible mountain peaks, Beonur is at the head of a huge number of mercenaries, barbarians and adventurers from all over the territory. He will succeed in a few years to put a stop to the invasions, bringing all the northern tribes under one clan. After a reign of a few decades, it is said that the old warrior preferred to spend the last years in the remote fortress of Torregrigia, in the company of his war trophies.

### Hakkan III

The correct title under which to address the King of Gwaldur is "His Transcendent Imperial Majesty, Supreme Emperor Hakkan III, Herald of Light". Although he is a human who is too busy maintaining his royal status and threatened on all sides by independence plots, he is considered a great strategist and diplomat, as well as a great orator. Famous for suffering from numerous paranoia, he is constantly assisted and escorted by an elite of powerful advisors in every field of knowledge. The Council tends to indulge the whims of the sovereign, knowing that the entire Gwaldur region is united only by his political skill.

### Herras The Immortal

A mysterious figure travels with Serenil Emuniel. Those who have met him speak of a human being who is shy and lonely, and prefer action to words. Little is known about him: it is rumored that he can be a Paladin and that his soul cannot be destroyed. Courageous, stubborn and wise, he nurtures devotion to the Prophet Serenil Emuniel, her protected one.

Herras hides a peculiar past. His body is a magical construct of exceptional complexity and unknown origin, and this gives him immunity to all attacks related to the control of the mind as well as all the advantages expected for the constructs. The origin of this particular condition is not known. During his travels, Herras knows many adventurers and shares their undertakings until he meets the Melian Oracle, which heralds him a new era for Aumyr.

Herras is very loyal, which does not tolerate betrayals of any kind. It has a kind and almost childish soul, naive but at the same time strong. Harras loves devotion in any form, tenacity and willpower, because his nature of immortal spirit makes him aware that he is part of several larger realities.

### Mannequin

A strange creature with many masks is often seen wandering through the rubble of ruined cities, intent on exchanging puns with adventurers and wayfarers. Mannequin is a powerful shape-shifting spirit who loves the adventurer's life. He serves as a court jester to many governments, going so far as to take a councilor's seat with the Emperor of Gwaldur. When he is not in the service of any ruler, he has an attitude detached from world affairs, preferring to distract himself with anecdotes about ancient Knowledge. No one knows the real history of this solitary spirit, to the point that many believe it is a brilliant permanent illusion created by a mad magician.

### Narak

The powerful Native Narak priest is constantly traveling around the world to warn people of imminent dangers, catastrophes, the rise of heroes to the rank of gods or great changes on Aumyr. Many adventurers consider him only a visionary madman, rather than a prophet with supernatural powers, of which he is actually the master. Narak is able to observe parallel dimensions unknown to other mortals, such as the Veil, the Time Plan and the Shadow Plan. He can interact with these dimensions as if he were in all or none at once. The Council is convinced that Narak is actually a powerful diviner, so his visions are always held in high regard.

### Paartuk

In the year 180 CE, a famous guild of Pendor thieves discovered a vast network of underground tunnels older than the city itself. The tales tell of how this network was only part of a series of deadly dungeons created by Thanaros' ancient sovereign demigod, Paartuk the Fallen, to protect his own tomb. The Society of Dorne organized several expeditions formed by the most experienced adventurers of Aumyr determined to unravel the mystery of the tomb, but none of them ever returned. Access to the area was later sealed with magical interdictions. If one were to discover the eternal burial place of the demigod, one could enjoy legendary fame.

### Serenil Emuniel

Also known as Melian's Oracle, The Prophet, The Seer. Travel in the company of Herras The Immortal, a mysterious paladin. She is dedicated to serving Melian as premonitory and high priestess. Her long life and her status as Oracle have allowed her to learn many skills and powers.

From an early age, she was educated by the dictates of the Cult of Melian, educated as a priestess and dragged from temple to temple for the whole of her life, without the possibility of following a personal path. Ducted royally, expert in divine spells, history, cartography and determined to help anyone, in 2210 CE he was elected Oracle of Nayalis and took service as High Priestess. Her contact with Melian is so strong that she took on the role of Chosen in 2270 CE.

Even if she has a deep desire for emancipation and adventure, Serenil is always seen as a High Priestess and her power never makes her free to make personal life choices. He is happy, however, to use his existence in the complete service of his divinity, both on his journey and in temples.

### Tar-Alund

The Natives believe that every six hundred years an individual is born with the ability to predict the future and with almost divine powers. Tar-Alund was the last prophet of the Ancient Age, but the first to predict the Arrival of the Five on Aumyr and the subsequent prophecy that will mark the beginning of a new Age in the world. Blind from birth, perhaps his powers were altered by a group of Meentum Matriarchs known for experimenting arcane magic on infants "blessed" by the gods. The Ancient Age was a time full of old rites and beliefs: the Native Tradition was in those days only a still shapeless amalgam of knowledge accessible only to a few who held the power. Beyond speculation, a large statue is dedicated to Tar-Alund in the square of the Tribunal of Meentum.

Beyond speculation, a large statue is dedicated to Tar-Alund in the square of the Tribunal of Meentum.

### Aktaros

In the city of Khoralis there is a meritocratic patriarchate headed by a Regent who has shown that he follows the way of the Great Father for life. Aktaros grows in the streets of the old city of Khoralis, dreaming of the deeds of Arak-Thorak as told in legends. The son of noble merchants, he soon made his way through the ranks of the city guard before becoming its natural leader. In 2358 CE, during a Xao-Thol attack on the city, Aktaros manages to escort the Matriarch safely to safety and dispel the wave of demonic creatures sent to kill her. He is thus named Army General and First Warrior, an honor reserved only for a few Natives. He will become Regent of Khoralis in 2372 CE.

### Akum-Ra

Since 2366 EC, the leader of the Black Shields organization is the powerful warrior Akum-Ra, a former gladiator of Pendor also known as the King of the Fosse. He is a huge ogre famous for his skill in the deadliest battles in the fighting arena. The last descendant of a lineage of creatures enslaved by Pendor's nobles, Akum-Ra has managed to win his freedom first and then control the city's militia through the blood of countless enemies. Today it is only rarely possible to witness his "performances" in the Pendor Pit, as his status as commander of the army often sees him engaged elsewhere.

### Alys Antar

Alys is a clever murderer and spy. Known in the world of high society with the nickname of "Hunter", her identity is a mystery. It is thought to be a woman with an attractive appearance and lethal ability to kill silently: some regions are willing to offer thousands of gold coins for her capture, although so far every attempt to identify her has failed.

Alys is much more than a murderer, she's a passionate woman. Her father, Morgon Antar, a powerful warrior at the service of the Council, was brutally murdered during a clash with some members of the Circle. Since her youth, Alys has learned to rely only on her own strength to survive in the wilderness, in search of her father's murderers. Eventually she will get her revenge a few years later, helping to avert a terrible plot aimed at subverting the world order. Since then, her lethal abilities have been among the most demanded on Aumyr.

Nobody can say that they really know her. A skilled manipulator and woman with a thousand faces, she can be a brave ally if you have enough money, motivation or ability to intrigue her. She contacts his employers privately, always with different identities. Many people think she lives in Damodar, even though her contracts oblige her to live an undercover life.

### Amos Lindale

Collector of rare antiquities, expert of the Natives and the ancient Askari, patron, adventurer. Amos Lindale claims to be the only true descendant of the famous explorer Arvath Lindale. Although this statement finds little support from official history, Amos is certainly a resourceful individual, in every sense. It is rumored that his heritage is considerable and almost equivalent to that of a region of Aumyr, a wealth handed down from generations and unspecified "ancestors". He owns several villas located throughout almost the entire continent, but he is often found in the company of adventurers, powerful nobles or at the court of some sovereign as an advisor. It is not uncommon that he is the principal (and the financier) of several expeditions, both private and on behalf of the Dorne Society.

### Doran Hallmon

Doran Hallmon is a famous cartographer and owner of a small shop in Viriana. After a brief period as an adventurer, he opened a cartography emporium, working on drawing and printing maps or parchments for scholars, bards, sorcerers or enchanters. He is much sought after for the high quality of his work. Many of his creations are admirable examples of art and are sold at a high price. Some suspect that Doran uses some kind of spell to make his maps able to track people, objects or other secret information. If he really had this power, many would kill to take it away from him.

### Dyamira

Diamyra is the daughter of a powerful adventurer from the Dorne Society. Her skills, perfected by a life of danger and experience always on the limit, are extraordinary. She is the youngest experienced adventurer known to date, surviving monsters, dungeons, death traps and a thousand other adventures. It is said that she has long lived on another plane, unsatisfied with the reality of the world. Every now and then some adventurer says he has met her, shared a few missions, only to see her return to wander the Plans. What is the reason for her melancholy remains a mystery.

### Erinn

The eldest daughter of one of the leaders of the Wolfguard, Erinn grows up in the snowy spaces of Nordavind, guiding many adventurers and experts who climb the mountains of the Frost Peaks. She is also awarded the title of "Sentinel of Ice", when she saves an entire group of clerics from the onslaught of an ogre army during a traverse of the dangerous Skard Pass. Her successes within the organization of the Guardia del Lupo allow her to obtain increasingly exclusive engagements as a guide and ranger, even in contexts and landscapes different from the northern regions where she grew up. She has a reputation as a tenacious, stubborn and very talkative adventurer.

### Garik

Garik is a halfling famous for escaping from various prisons, currently an adventurer, thief, storyteller and cavalcade. Also known as Garik of Dragons, Mighty Garik, Dominator of the Pit, Dispenser of Dreams, he is very famous among the adventurers of Aumyr. He often performs in taverns in small towns as a bard and entertainer, mainly in out-of-the-way or exotic places, so much so as to cause perplexity to the simpler people. He often recruits adventurers in taverns and town squares. It is said that Garik is the only thief to have escaped from the Kartar Fortress, but many people think that he is just very lucky to still be alive.

### Jherteg

Tavernier, adventurer and bard, Jherteg "Black Unicorn" spends your time running the tavern that bears his name in the town of Nayalis. Many Elven patrons avoid the inn, convinced that Jherteg has too much fun making fun of the city's dark past, telling too many details about his unlikely adventurous missions among the Ruins of Mel'Shir, or other historical sites. Some of them see him face demons and dragons, forge magical objects in the ruins of Kandros, and more. Those who know him think that the stories he tells are just a ploy to attract famous and less famous adventurers to the inn. However, no one can deny that he is an excellent bard and entertainer.

### Joan Ryde

There are many bards who claim to have composed the definitive ballad about the story of Captain Joan Ryde. The illegitimate daughter of a merchant sailor and a noble priestess, Joan grew up in the shadow of ships and battles, on several galleons on a commercial route in the Sea of Night. At a young age she embarked on the "Dragon", a large war galley under the control of the Damodar Consortium. Secretly serving several pirate lords, he came into contact with numerous ancient treasures and artifacts found on mysterious islands even beyond the Sea of Night. It is believed that his exploration activities have served to map much of the world's unexplored coastline, including unknown islands beyond the charts.

### Jondar Krall

Knight and wandering warrior, Jondar is considered almost a deity among the Sons of Hardon. An undisputed protagonist at the war tables, he is also an excellent strategist and military engineer. With an impeccable dynasty of great heroes behind him (the Krall family helped rebuild the village of Shieldbane after the Disaster of the Islands of the Dead in 110 CE), his strength is on a par with his cunning in battle to the point of making some elderly wizards suspect that a kind of divine blessing runs in his blood. Today many members of the family have disappeared or have preferred to live a life withdrawn from society.

### Kaien Merrill

An elderly elf, wrapped in unusual adventurer's clothes, is used to entertain young students of magic but also simple passers-by at the Highspire tower. He is also known as the Old Kaien and is seen by many as an alienated homeless man who is the victim of some strange magic experiment. Instead, he is Kaien Merrill, a powerful old magician and teacher of magic at Highspire School. Some students claim that he is a member of the powerful Order of Gnosis, others think that his condition depends on a powerful and ancient curse. Whatever the truth, the powers of the Old Kaien are a source of stories and tales.

### Kellon Serraj

For many monks, Kellon is a legend. He is a lone warrior who prefers forced isolation rather than life in civilized outposts. His skill in hand-to-hand combat is almost supernatural, the result of experience gained after years of study and training. Many think that Kellon may be the Grand Master of a secret order of monks residing in the fortress of Faux Edge. It happens that he wanders among the villages to dispense teachings to young warriors and clerics from all regions. Sometimes he even chooses an apprentice to take with him during his long periods of contemplative wandering. None of these young followers has ever returned to civilian life.

### Leidan

Enigmatic figure and companion of Erinn, Leidan seems to be a monk who grew up respecting the Vow of Silence. A skilled warrior, he is said to have psychic powers capable of exploring the recesses of the mind. He is often seen near ancient dungeons and temples. Given his unique ability, he is seen with respect, to the point that many monks have dedicated their lives to following his teachings, taken from the tales of those who had the good fortune to meet him.

### Liseth Baelyn

For many years a warrior adventurer of few words has been fleeing her past. The few who have met her have had the impression of being in the presence of a queen. This would be Liseth Baelyn, the lost daughter of King Hardon Baelyn, a former lost Highpine dynasty. The King is now deceased and without male heirs to whom to transfer the family fortune, so Liseth soon finds herself threatened from a young age by power struggles and revenge of rival Houses. She decides to take the path of the wandering adventurer, fleeing one night from her residence with nothing more than a handful of coins and a large sword. Since then, Elder King Baelyn has been desperately trying to find his lost daughter and bring her back to the life that belongs to her.

### Morgaine Mayev

Morgaine Mayev grows up on a farm in the village of Skotis, a lonely farming village on the edge of the deserts of Thanaros. As a young man she learns of the existence of an old, nameless hermit lost in the desert, with legendary powers. Attracted by the mystery, one day she leaves her family to find the old hermit so she can learn his secrets, but soon her travels lead her to the underground tomb of a powerful vampire from the past, who forces her to serve him at his hidden court in exchange for knowledge and knowledge. Many adventurers think that Morgaine spent several years of arcane learning with her sinister mentor before destroying the old tomb and escaping.

### Sari

Sari's past is nebulous and mysterious as well as the arcane arts of which she is a master. Protected by the Council from a young age because of her uncommon magical talent, Sari grows up in the shadow of the libraries and halls of the Grey Academy of Fivestar, surpassing any other student in power and knowledge, earning the favor of many powerful enchanters. Stubborn and courageous, the Council sometimes sends her undercover with rival wizards as an apprentice, or on various espionage missions and exploration of ruins or dungeons alongside powerful adventurers. She is thought to have acquired even more exotic and unnatural powers during numerous missions in search of Askari Knowledge.

### Ser Ledas

Once a devout Vel-Shar worshipper, it is said that to protect his beloved from a ritual sacrifice, Ledas went mad and killed all his brothers. Later he settled in a solitary ruined temple in the Misty Mountains, proclaiming himself Knight of Melian. Since then he has travelled as a wandering vagabond, helping anyone who asks for his help. Several adventurers have been rescued thanks to his intervention, and Ser Ledas never asks for anything in payment for his services. It is said that after his escape from the cult of the Will of Vel-Shar, he often finds himself tormented by memories of his dark past.

### Valerie Ross

Every powerful nobleman has a vast network of collaborators and informers who help to keep him in political power. Valerie Ross grows up among royal courts, plots and political struggles. Strong character, endowed with enormous charisma and remarkable diplomatic skills, she soon earned the respect of many noblemen and potential rulers. Her work consists in managing a vast network of contacts that allow her to infiltrate various organizations, control their members and manipulate the consensus of the people towards one political figure rather than another. Her adventurous past allows her to live an affluent life, even in the case of assignments in distant lands, or undercover for some time.

### Wortus Malagar

It is said that the old Dwarf Master Wortus Malagar lives confined in a hut in the Forest of Ebor, on the slopes of an unexplored ruin. A former adventurer, inventor, artifact expert and wise hermit, he spends his time between art and magic, remembering past times. Some of his craft creations can be seen in Aumyr's capitals: mechanical fountains, sumptuous parks and monumental buildings. Many adventurers think that he hides a large collection of rare treasures somewhere in the forest, others claim that the old hermit is long dead, with all his riches.

### Ylindal

No one knows for sure where this graceful elf came from, but it is known that he began to make a name for himself by frequenting inns and taverns in Aumyr, where he performed epic and poetic ballads. He usually wears red hair gathered from a braid and dresses in bright clothes. Not many are the lucky ones who can say they have had adventures with Ylindal, but those who have are the ones who tell of his enigmatic way of expressing himself and his preference for letting his ballads speak for themselves. There is a very special one, which talks about how a demon took possession of his body a long time ago and how the elf managed to free himself from his grip by subjugating him, not after a few trips and struggles. It is not known whether the composition tells the truth or is the result of a bizarre and imaginative mind, the fact is that the few travel companions of the elf say they felt an enormous and mysterious energy pervade their bodies during the most difficult situations.
