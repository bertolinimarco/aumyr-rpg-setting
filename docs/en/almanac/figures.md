# The Figures

This is a deck of one hundred (100) Figures (or cards). Each card represents an illustration and below it, a number. Each one possesses a power that can alter the very nature of reality. A special Figure is the number 100, and it represents the Spirit of the Deck. Because of its powerful nature, only a few know of its existence. The origins of the Deck are not known.

## A legendary artefact

**Properties**:
Figures, as deck cards, are indestructible and unalterable. The effects of Figures are cumulative. The deck itself cannot be destroyed, nor can it be damaged in any way. If the Deck is lost, it magically reappears in the hands of its Bearer, likewise if he tries to sell or get rid of it.

All powers and spells are handled by the Deck itself, or rather, by the special 'Spirit' Figure who represents the Spirit of the Deck: in a sense she _is the Deck_.
This Figure, even if it rarely intervenes, manages the Deck's owner at will and has decision-making powers with respect to the extraction of Figures (one, none, or several Figures at once), and with respect to all the effects they contain (duration of the spell, retroactive effects, target locations, number of items, etc.).

Figure effects are to be considered as having no saving grace mechanics: it is therefore not possible to evade the effects of Figures, unless Spirit wishes to do so, but always with a reason, be it explicit or hidden.

The Figure of the Spirit when (and if) it appears, can perform any action at will, even if not foreseen by the other Figures.

The drawing of the Figures is random and in no way can the Player decide to draw any card he wishes, unless the Figure itself (or the Spirit) says so. Once drawn, the Player may look at the Figure and decide whether or not to activate it, without consequence. Once activated, the Figure magically returns to the deck without having to be put away. This effect serves (also) to prevent the Deck from being incomplete with all 100 Figures.

Each Figure represents an image or scene that may prove to be misleadingly predictive of its contents. The Deck (The Spirit) may decide at any time to change Bearer at its discretion.
Some Figures bear inscriptions in an unknown language. It is probably the native language of the deck or it is also possible that the deck uses it when it wants to hide something.

The effects are both positive and negative: there are Figures in it that cause events that can greatly affect the life of a Player, his allies, the place where he is, and sometimes even the entire game world.
For this reason, the deck is one of the most sought-after, powerful and dangerous objects in existence.

**Note:** The GM is advised to read the effects of the Figure before revealing them to the Player, because some Figure effects should NOT be revealed.
Effects sometimes include mechanics regarding 'saving throws', characteristic values and more: they are designed for use with the D&DÂ© game system, but can be adapted to any regulatory system, it is up to the GM to decide how to handle them.

### 01 - Spirit (Black)

Figure 01 represents the Spirit of the Figures, coloured in black, in the act of pointing at the Player.

::: details Effects
The Spirit appears and places the whole Deck of Figures in front of the Player. It draws a card and activates it as if the Player himself had activated it. The choice of the Figure may then be random (draw by the GM) or may be chosen by the GM.

### 02 - Key

Figure 02 represents a Key with ornaments of an unknown magical nature engraved on it. 

::: details Effects
A Player who knows 5 (five) or more languages may make a test on each one to see if they belong to his sphere of knowledge in an attempt to decipher the symbols engraved on the Key in the Figure. If he passes the test, he will find that they belong to a forgotten ancient language: in each case one of the possible meanings could be: "The Gate shows the Way" or "the Gate and Gates are with the Key Bearer".
The Player acquires a key identical to the one in the Figure. The key is to be considered a minor artefact capable of opening any lock in any world, whether material or non-material and on any Plane of Existence. Its use is unique: the key disintegrates after use.

In reality, it was the Tower and Ruins Figure that led him to that location and created the conditions for him to be there. The motivation is the GM's choice: he may have been accused of a crime, or mistaken for someone else, it could be revenge from a character he met in a previous adventure, and more.

### 52 - Hills

Figure 52 represents a hilly landscape, with a river running through it. In the background, a group of adventurers.

::: details Effects

The Player is approached by a group of people who know a particular key to a mission he is carrying out. However, these characters are actually against the Player's interests because they will do anything to prevent him from solving the mission. It is up to the Player to decide whether:

- eliminate them (in which case they will disappear instead of dying)
- make them go their own way and leave him alone (in which case, the Character will receive bonuses at the GM's discretion)

In case he succeeds in the second scenario, the characters may reveal that they have been imprisoned by the Figures of Koth: some of the (many) adventurers forced to serve Spirit of the Deck and the Figures, cursed by some effect from the past that forced them to obey. If the Player succeeds in freeing them, he may earn additional bonuses at the GM's discretion, but the Deck Spirit may well be happy with this choice...
:::

### 53 - Jewels

::: details Effects

:::

### 55 - [Black Figure]

Figure 55 is completely black: a surface that appears to absorb light. There are no images, no writing.

::: details Effects
This Figure is the most dangerous of the Figures: it was created to prevent the deck from acquiring a high number of Bearers, so that the immense powers of the deck would not be used for purposes other than the will of the Spirit of the Figures. The Player makes a saving throw (or equivalent) at the discretion of the GM: If he fails the throw, his soul enters the dimensional space of the Figure, which can hold an unlimited number of souls.

In the dimensional space, there is a number of souls at the GM's discretion: all previous Figure Bearer beings. The Player can interact with them, and some of them are so ancient that they do not even speak common language. Needless to say, should the Player talk to the souls (and they talk to him), upon returning to the Material Plane he will be able to acquire a range of Knowledge that might otherwise be impossible to acquire on the Material Plane.

Should he succeed with the previous saving throw, nothing happens for 1d6 minutes. Thereafter, should he have the Figure in his hand again, he is forced to roll a twenty-sided die. If the result is greater than 17, the player may decide whether to release a soul locked in dimensional space inside the figure. If it is less, roll another die: in this case, if the result is less than or equal to five (5), all souls will be released from the deck...

Then roll a twenty-sided die. If the result is equal to or greater than 15, the Player will encounter a group called the "Fellowship of Travel", a group of adventurers who specialise in travel and discovery spells: they may offer to transport the Player and his allies to any point in the world, or they may create a Portal and more.

The Player discovers (in a way and at a time decided by the GM) access to an ancient, long-forgotten mine or dungeon. The place has a unique background, some ideas might be as follows:

- It is rumoured to lead directly to one of the Ancient Portals of Yoth, a huge place of knowledge and antiquity, older than any known civilisation.
- It passes through the Underground and is said to be one of the few links between the surface and an immense underground city, perhaps a new Ancient Ruin.
- The mine is said to have many levels, many of which are still unexplored. Some of these levels may be connected to places of worship of ancient deities, or to places of magical power, or to places of knowledge.
- It seems that the dungeon is the cleverly disguised refuge of a group of adventurers who have retired from the adventurous life and live in peace and tranquillity.
- Some claim that the dungeon is where the Deck of Figures was created, and that there is a direct connection to the Spirit of Figures...

For example, if the adventuring party of which the Player is a member must travel to a location, it is forgotten by the characters, it does not appear on maps, the party cannot find any information, etc... This curse can be important on a narrative level for the GM, to lose track of a place, of a character, of an object that perhaps the GM considers too important to be found.

- If the Player wants to investigate the ship, he may discover that in an earlier period it belonged to a group of pirates, who used it to raid and pillage.

For example, if a good elf exists in the Material Plane, an evil elf will exist in the Mirror Kingdom.
