## External Beings

### Mardok

In 188 EC, the city was the scene of one of the most significant events in modern history. Mardok, a frightening semi-divinity from another Plane, almost completely destroyed the city and sowed devastation throughout the southern part of the island. An army formed by inhabitants of the continent, adventurers, Natives and other creatures, faced the ancestral threat, and the soul of the creature was trapped in a Cube of the Aeons, a powerful artifact possessed by some members of the Eternal Wheel. The city has been reconstructed as a memory of union and Council, and has been a pivotal point of the exchange of cultures between the Natives and other races.

## Monsters

### Kartaros

Kartaros was an ancient red dragon, probably one of the most powerful creatures on the planet since the time of the ancient Askari. Its awakening from the bowels of the earth was devastating, in the year 1113 EC. The dragon invaded the city of Kartar, destroying almost all the houses and created its lair in a complex of underground caves and caverns. The dragon was defeated after several battles, by a handful of heroes sent by the Dorne Society. Some members of the Circle claim that his essence is immortal, others fear that some lost ritual may one day bring him back to life.

### Orog-Mar

The giant ogre Orog-Mar was the leader of a large clan of orcs, goblins and other creatures of the Nordavind mountains. Defeated by Beonur, his descendants swore vengeance against the entire population of the region and surrounding areas, aiming to restore Nordavind as a pure wilderness. The Dorne Society monitors the number of orcs in the Orog-Mar clan and its lieutenants, direct descendants of the giant orc. The presence of numerous clues among the villages and adventurers convinced the Society that Orog-Mar was in fact also a powerful wizard, powers without which he could not unite in a single army several creatures including giants, white dragons and races of the underground mountains.
